.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBreloc_perl\fR program will copy a perl installation wholesale to a
new location.  During the copy it edits path names in the copied files
to reflect the new location.
.PP
The \fItopath\fR is the file system location where the perl installation
should be copied to.  This location should normally not already
exists.  A directory will be created at \fItopath\fR and then populated
with the \fIbin\fR, \fIlib\fR, \fIhtml\fR and \fIman\fR directories of the perl
installation.
.PP
The perl installation copied is the one where \fBreloc_perl\fR itself
resides, but this can be overridden by providing a \fIfrompath\fR.
Running \fBreloc_perl\fR without arguments will show what this path is,
as well as a short usage message.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
The following options are recognized by the \f(CW\*(C`reloc_perl\*(C'\fR program:
.IP "\fB\-a\fR" 5
.IX Item "-a"
The \fBreloc_perl\fR program will refuse to copy if \fItopath\fR is longer
than \fIfrompath\fR.  This option overrides this restriction.  The
\&\fItopath\fR must still be shorter than the path built into the perl
binary.
.IP "\fB\-b\fR" 5
.IX Item "-b"
Don't delete the backups created during the edits performed in \fItopath\fR.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR" 5
.IX Item "-d"
Delete the perl installation that was copied.  Use with care!
.IP "\fB\-e\fR \fIpath\fR" 5
.IX Item "-e path"
Edit files to contain this path instead of the \fItopath\fR.  This allow
relocation to a different location than where the files themselves are
copied.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR \fIlogfile\fR" 5
.IX Item "-f logfile"
Creates \fIlogfile\fR and writes the full path name of
each file that was modified (one line per file).
.IP "\fB\-i\fR" 5
.IX Item "-i"
Edit perl installation at \fItopath\fR in-place.  Makes no attempt to
move tree and the \fB\-d\fR is ignored.  This option is assumed if
\&\fItopath\fR exists, is a directory, and \fIfrompath\fR doesn't exist.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR" 5
.IX Item "-t"
Only edit the text files.  When this option is used, the restriction
that \fItopath\fR must not be longer than \fIfrompath\fR is relaxed.
.IP "\fB\-r\fR" 5
.IX Item "-r"
Do not run \fIranlib\fR any \fI*.a\fR files that were edited.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR" 5
.IX Item "-v"
Print a trace of what's going on.

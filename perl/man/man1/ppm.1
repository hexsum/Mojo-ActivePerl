.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \f(CW\*(C`ppm\*(C'\fR program is the package manager for ActivePerl.  It
simplifies the task of locating, installing, upgrading and removing
Perl packages.
.PP
Invoking \f(CW\*(C`ppm\*(C'\fR without arguments brings up the graphical user interface,
but ppm can also be used as a command line tool where the first argument
provide the name of the sub-command to invoke.  The following sub-commands
are recognized:
.IP "\fBppm area init\fR \fIarea\fR" 4
.IX Item "ppm area init area"
Will initialize the given area so that \s-1PPM\s0 starts tracking the
packages it contains.
.Sp
\&\s-1PPM\s0 allows for the addition of new install areas, which is useful for
shared ActivePerl installations where the user does not have write
permissions for the \fIsite\fR and \fIperl\fR areas.  New install areas are
added by simply setting up new library directories for perl to search,
and \s-1PPM\s0 will set up install areas to match.  The easiest way to add
library directories for perl is to specify them in the \f(CW\*(C`PERL5LIB\*(C'\fR
environment variable, see perlrun for details.  \s-1PPM\s0 will create
\&\fIetc\fR, \fIbin\fR, \fIhtml\fR directories as needed when installing
packages.  If the last segment of the library directory path is \fIlib\fR
then the other directories will be created as siblings of the \fIlib\fR
directory, otherwise they will be subdirectories.
.IP "\fBppm area list\fR [ \fB\-\-csv\fR [ \fIsep\fR ] ] [ \fB\-\-no\-header\fR ]" 4
.IX Item "ppm area list [ --csv [ sep ] ] [ --no-header ]"
Lists the available install areas.  The list displays the name, number
of installed packages and \f(CW\*(C`lib\*(C'\fR directory location for each install
area.  If that area is read-only, the name appears in parenthesis.  You
will not be able to install packages or remove packages in these areas.
The default install area is marked with a \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR after its name.
.Sp
The order of the listed install areas is the order perl uses when
searching for modules.  Modules installed in earlier areas override
modules installed in later ones.
.Sp
The \fB\-\-csv\fR option selects \s-1CSV \s0(comma-separated values) format for the
output. The default field separator can be overridden by the argument
following \fB\-\-csv\fR.
.Sp
The \fB\-\-no\-header\fR option suppresses column headings.
.IP "\fBppm area sync\fR [ \fIarea\fR ... ]" 4
.IX Item "ppm area sync [ area ... ]"
Synchronizes installed packages, including those installed by means
other than \s-1PPM \s0(e.g. the \s-1CPAN\s0 shell), with the ppm database. \s-1PPM\s0
searches the install area(s) for packages, making \s-1PPM\s0 database entries
if they do not already exist, or dropping entries for packages that no
longer exist.  When used without an \fIarea\fR argument, all install areas
are synced.
.IP "\fBppm config\fR \fIname\fR [ \fIvalue\fR ]" 4
.IX Item "ppm config name [ value ]"
Get or set various \s-1PPM\s0 configuration values.
.Sp
The following configuration options might be of interest:
.RS 4
.IP "arch" 4
.IX Item "arch"
The architecture of the current database.  For internal use.  Don't change this.
.IP "repo_dbimage" 4
.IX Item "repo_dbimage"
If set to '1' look for \fIpackage.db.gz\fR indexes in repositories before looking
for the \fIpackage.xml\fR file.
.IP "install_html" 4
.IX Item "install_html"
If set to '0' don't generate and install the \s-1HTML\s0 version of the documentation
for the modules installed.  This makes installation considerably faster.
.IP "gui.*" 4
.IX Item "gui.*"
Various settings for the graphical user interface.

.IP "\fBppm config list\fR" 4
.IX Item "ppm config list"

.IP "\fBppm describe\fR \fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "ppm describe num"

result.
.IP "\fBppm files\fR \fIpkg\fR" 4
.IX Item "ppm files pkg"
Lists the full path name of the files belonging to the given package,
one line per file.
.IP "\fBppm help\fR [ \fIsubcommand\fR ]" 4
.IX Item "ppm help [ subcommand ]"
Prints the documentation for ppm (this file).

.IX Item "ppm install num [ --area area ] [ --nodeps ]"
.PD
Install a package and its dependencies.
.Sp
The argument to \fBppm install\fR can be the name of a package, the name of
a module provided by the package, the file name or the \s-1URL\s0 of a \s-1PPMX\s0 or \s-1PPD\s0 file,
or the associated number for the package returned by the last \f(CW\*(C`ppm
search\*(C'\fR command.
.Sp
Package or module names can be repeated to install multiple modules in one go.
These forms can also be intermixed.
.Sp
If the package or module requested is already installed, \s-1PPM\s0 installs
nothing.  The \fB\-\-force\fR option can be used to make \s-1PPM\s0 install a
package even if it's already present.  With \fB\-\-force\fR \s-1PPM\s0 resolves
file conflicts during package installation or upgrade by allowing
files already installed by other packages to be overwritten and
ownership transferred to the new package.  This may break the package
that originally owned the file.
.Sp
By default, new packages are installed in the \f(CW\*(C`site\*(C'\fR area, but if the
\&\f(CW\*(C`site\*(C'\fR area is read only, and there are user-defined areas set up, the
first user-defined area is used as the default instead.  Use the
\&\fB\-\-area\fR option to install the package into an alternative location.
.Sp
The \fB\-\-nodeps\fR option makes \s-1PPM\s0 attempt to install the package
without resolving any dependencies the package might have.
.IP "\fBppm list\fR [ \fIarea\fR ] [ \fB\-\-matching\fR \fIpattern\fR ]  [ \fB\-\-csv\fR [ \fIsep\fR ] ] [ \fB\-\-no\-header\fR ] [ \-\-\-fields \fBfieldlist\fR ]" 4
.IX Item "ppm list [ area ] [ --matching pattern ] [ --csv [ sep ] ] [ --no-header ] [ ---fields fieldlist ]"
List installed packages.  If the \fIarea\fR argument is not provided, list
the content of all install areas.
.Sp
The \fB\-\-matching\fR option limits the output to only include packages
matching the given \fIpattern\fR.  See \fBppm search\fR for \fIpattern\fR syntax.
.Sp
The \fB\-\-csv\fR option selects \s-1CSV \s0(comma-separated values) format for the
output. The default field separator can be overridden by the argument
following \fB\-\-csv\fR.
.Sp
The \fB\-\-no\-header\fR option suppress printing of the column headings.
.Sp
The \fB\-\-fields\fR argument can be used to select what fields to show.
The argument is a comma separated list of the following field names:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBname\fR" 4
.IX Item "name"
The package name.  This field is always shown, but if specified
alone get rid of the decorative box.
.IP "\fBversion\fR" 4

.IX Item "ppm repo add name"
Add the named resposity for \s-1PPM\s0 to fetch packages from.  The names
recognized are shown by the \fBppm repo suggest\fR command.  Use \fBppm
repo add activestate\fR if you want to restore the default ActiveState
repo after deleting it.
.IP "\fBppm repo add\fR \fIurl\fR [ \fIname\fR ] [ \fB\-\-username\fR \fIuser\fR [ \fB\-\-password\fR \fIpassword\fR ]" 4

.IP "\fBppm repo\fR \fInum\fR \fIcmd\fR" 4
.IX Item "ppm repo num cmd"
Alias for \fBppm repo\fR \fIcmd\fR \fInum\fR.
.IP "\fBppm repo off\fR \fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "ppm repo off num"
Disable repository number \fInum\fR for \fBppm install\fR or \fBppm search\fR.
.IP "\fBppm repo on\fR \fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "ppm repo on num"
Enable repository number \fInum\fR if it has been previously disabled with
\&\fBppm repo off\fR.
.IP "\fBppm repo rename\fR \fInum\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "ppm repo rename num name"
Change name by which the given repo is known.
.IP "\fBppm repo location\fR \fInum\fR \fIurl\fR" 4
.IX Item "ppm repo location num url"
Change the location of the given repo.  This will make \s-1PPM\s0
forget all cached data from the old repository and try to refetch it
from the new location.
.IP "\fBppm repo search\fR ..." 4
.IX Item "ppm repo search ..."
Alias for \fBppm search\fR.
.IP "\fBppm repo suggest\fR" 4
.IX Item "ppm repo suggest"
List some known repositories that can be added with \fBppm add\fR.  The
list only include repositories that are usable by this perl installation.
.IP "\fBppm repo sync\fR [ \fB\-\-force\fR ] [ \fB\-\-max\-ppd\fR \fImax\fR ] [ \fInum\fR ]" 4
.IX Item "ppm repo sync [ --force ] [ --max-ppd max ] [ num ]"
Synchronize local cache of packages found in the enabled repositories.
With the \fB\-\-force\fR option, download state from remote repositories even
if the local state has not expired yet.  If \fInum\fR is provided, only sync
the given repository.
.Sp
\&\s-1PPM\s0 will need to download every \s-1PPD\s0 file for repositories that don't
provide a summary file (\fIpackage.xml\fR).  This can be very slow for
large repositories.  Thus \s-1PPM\s0 refuses to start the downloads with
repositores linking to more that 100 \s-1PPD\s0 files unless the \fB\-\-max\-ppd\fR
option provides a higher limit.
.IP "\fBppm search\fR \fIpattern\fR" 4
.IX Item "ppm search pattern"
Search for packages matching \fIpattern\fR in all enabled repositories.
.Sp
For \fIpattern\fR, use the wildcard \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR to match any number of characters
and the wildcard \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR to match a single character.  For example, to find
packages starting with the string \*(L"List\*(R" search for \f(CW\*(C`list*\*(C'\fR. Searches
are case insensitive.
.Sp
If \fIpattern\fR contains \f(CW\*(C`::\*(C'\fR, \s-1PPM\s0 will search for packages that provide
modules matching the pattern.
.Sp
If \fIpattern\fR matches the name of a package exactly (case-sensitively),
only that package is shown.  A \fIpattern\fR without wildcards that does
not match any package names exactly is used for a substring search
against available package names (i.e. treated the same as
"\fB*\fR\fIpattern\fR\fB*\fR").
.Sp
The output format depends on how many packages match.  If there is only
one match, the \fBppm describe\fR format is used.  If only a few packages
match, limited information is displayed.  If many packages match, only
the package names and version numbers are displayed, one per line.
.Sp
The number prefixing each entry in search output can be used to look
up full information with \fBppm describe\fR \fInum\fR, dependencies with
\&\fBppm tree\fR \fInum\fR or to install the package with \fBppm install\fR
\&\fInum\fR.
.IP "\fBppm tree\fR \fIpackage\fR" 4
.IX Item "ppm tree package"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBppm tree\fR \fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "ppm tree num"
.PD
Shows all the dependencies (recusively) for a particular package.  The
package can be identified by a package name or the associated number
for the package returned by the last \f(CW\*(C`ppm search\*(C'\fR command.
.IP "\fBppm uninstall\fR ..." 4
.IX Item "ppm uninstall ..."
Alias for \fBppm remove\fR.
.IP "\fBppm update\fR ..." 4
.IX Item "ppm update ..."
Alias for \fBppm upgrade\fR.
.IP "\fBppm upgrade\fR [ \fB\-\-install\fR ] [ \fB\-\-area\fR \fIarea\fR ]" 4
.IX Item "ppm upgrade [ --install ] [ --area area ]"
List packages that there are upgrades available for.  With
\&\fB\-\-install\fR option install the upgrades as well.
.IP "\fBppm upgrade\fR [ \fB\-\-area\fR \fIarea\fR ] \fIpkg\fR" 4
.IX Item "ppm upgrade [ --area area ] pkg"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBppm upgrade\fR [ \fB\-\-area\fR \fIarea\fR ] \fImodule\fR" 4
.IX Item "ppm upgrade [ --area area ] module"
.PD
Upgrades the specified package or module if an upgrade is available in
one of the currently enabled repositories.
.Sp
If \fIarea\fR is given; install the upgrade to the given area instead of the
default.  You are responsible for making sure that the given area isn't
shadowed by another that contains an older version of the upgraded module.  If
so the upgrade would be not effective.
.Sp
If no \fIarea\fR is given, then ppm tries to apply the upgrade to the same area
that the module was previously installed in.  If the module was installed in
a read-only area or not installed, then the default install location is used.
.IP "\fBppm verify\fR [ \fIpkg\fR ]" 4
.IX Item "ppm verify [ pkg ]"
Checks that the installed files are still present and unmodified.  If
the package name is given, only that packages is verified.
.IP "\fBppm version\fR" 4
.IX Item "ppm version"
Will print the version of \s-1PPM\s0 and a copyright notice.
.SH "FILES"
.IX Header "FILES"

\&\s-1XML\s0 files containing meta information about packages.  Each package has
its own .ppd file.  See ActivePerl::PPM::PPD for additional
information.
.IP "\fIpackage.xml\fR" 4
.IX Item "package.xml"
Meta information about repositories.  When a repository is added, \s-1PPM\s0
looks for this file and if present, monitors it too stay in sync with
the state of the repository.
.IP "\fIpackage.lst\fR" 4
.IX Item "package.lst"
Same as \fIpackage.xml\fR but \s-1PPM 3\s0 compatible.  \s-1PPM\s0 will use this file
if \fIpackage.xml\fR is not available.
.IP "\fIpackage.db.gz\fR" 4
.IX Item "package.db.gz"
The same information as found in \fIpackage.xml\fR as a compressed SQLite database
image using \s-1PPM\s0's internal database schema.  Repositories that provide this image
should also provide an \fIpackage.xml\fR with the same information.
.Sp
When only one repo is used it's faster for the client to just download and use
this database image, instead of parsing the \fIpackage.xml\fR and build the
database from it locally.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
The following environment variables affect how \s-1PPM\s0 behaves:
.ie n .IP """ACTIVEPERL_PPM_DEBUG""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWACTIVEPERL_PPM_DEBUG\fR" 4
.IX Item "ACTIVEPERL_PPM_DEBUG"
If set to a \s-1TRUE\s0 value, makes \s-1PPM\s0 print more internal diagnostics.
.ie n .IP """ACTIVEPERL_PPM_BOX_CHARS""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWACTIVEPERL_PPM_BOX_CHARS\fR" 4
.IX Item "ACTIVEPERL_PPM_BOX_CHARS"
Select what kind of box drawing characters to use for the \f(CW\*(C`ppm *
list\*(C'\fR outputs.  Valid values are \f(CW\*(C`ascii\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`dos\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`unicode\*(C'\fR.  The
default varies.
.ie n .IP """ACTIVEPERL_PPM_HOME""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWACTIVEPERL_PPM_HOME\fR" 4
.IX Item "ACTIVEPERL_PPM_HOME"
If set, use this directory to store state and configuration
information for \s-1PPM. \s0 This defaults to
\&\fI\f(CI$LOCAL_APPDATA\fI/ActiveState/ActivePerl/$VERSION\fR on Windows and
\&\fI\f(CI$HOME\fI/.ActivePerl/$VERSION/\fR on Unix systems.
.ie n .IP """ACTIVEPERL_PPM_LOG_CONS""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWACTIVEPERL_PPM_LOG_CONS\fR" 4
.IX Item "ACTIVEPERL_PPM_LOG_CONS"
If set to a \s-1TRUE\s0 value, make \s-1PPM\s0 print any log output to the console as
well.
.ie n .IP """DBI_TRACE""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWDBI_TRACE\fR" 4
.IX Item "DBI_TRACE"
\&\s-1PPM\s0 uses \s-1DBI\s0 to access the internal SQLite databases. Setting
\&\s-1DBI_TRACE\s0 allow you to see what queries are performed.  Output goes to
\&\s-1STDERR. \s0 See \s-1DBI\s0 for further details.
.ie n .IP """http_proxy""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWhttp_proxy\fR" 4
.IX Item "http_proxy"
\&\s-1PPM\s0 uses \s-1LWP\s0 to access remote repositories.  If you need \s-1HTTP\s0
traffic pass via a proxy server to reach the repository, you must set
the \f(CW\*(C`http_proxy\*(C'\fR environment variable.  Some examples:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   Using bash:
\&       export http_proxy=http://proxy.mycompany.com
\&
\&   Using cmd.exe:
\&       set http_proxy=http://username:password@proxy.mycompany.com:8008

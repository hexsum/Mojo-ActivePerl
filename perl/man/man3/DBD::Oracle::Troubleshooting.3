DBD::Oracle::Troubleshooting  \- Tips and Hints to Troubleshoot DBD::Oracle
.SH "VERSION"
.IX Header "VERSION"
version 1.74
.SH "CONNECTING TO ORACLE"
.IX Header "CONNECTING TO ORACLE"
If you are reading this it is assumed that you have successfully
installed DBD::Oracle and you are having some problems connecting to
Oracle.
.PP
First off you will have to tell DBD::Oracle where the binaries reside
for the Oracle client it was compiled against.  This is the case when
you encounter a
.PP
.Vb 1
\& DBI connect(\*(Aq\*(Aq,\*(Aqsystem\*(Aq,...) failed: ERROR OCIEnvNlsCreate.
.Ve
.PP
error in Linux or in Windows when you get
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  OCI.DLL not found
.Ve
.PP
The solution to this problem in the case of Linux is to ensure your
\&'\s-1ORACLE_HOME\s0' (or \s-1LD_LIBRARY_PATH\s0 for InstantClient) environment
variable points to the correct directory.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  export ORACLE_HOME=/app/oracle/product/xx.x.x
.Ve
.PP
For Windows the solution is to add this value to you \s-1PATH\s0
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  PATH=c:\eapp\eoracle\eproduct\exx.x.x;%PATH%
.Ve
.PP
If you get past this stage and get a
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  ORA\-12154: TNS:could not resolve the connect identifier specified
.Ve
.PP
error then the most likely cause is \s-1DBD::ORACLE\s0 cannot find your .ORA
(\fI\s-1TNSNAMES.ORA\s0\fR, \fI\s-1LISTENER.ORA\s0\fR, \fI\s-1SQLNET.ORA\s0\fR) files. This can be
solved by setting the \s-1TNS_ADMIN\s0 environment variable to the directory
where these files can be found.
.PP
If you get to this stage and you have either one of the following
errors;
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  ORA\-12560: TNS:protocol adapter error
\&  ORA\-12162: TNS:net service name is incorrectly specified
.Ve
.PP
usually means that DBD::Oracle can find the listener but the it cannot connect to the \s-1DB\s0 because the listener cannot find the \s-1DB\s0 you asked for.
.SS "Oracle utilities"
.IX Subsection "Oracle utilities"
If you are still having problems connecting then the Oracle adapters
utility may offer some help. Run these two commands:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $ORACLE_HOME/bin/adapters
\&  $ORACLE_HOME/bin/adapters $ORACLE_HOME/bin/sqlplus
.Ve
.PP
and check the output. The \*(L"Protocol Adapters\*(R" should include at least \*(L"\s-1IPC\s0 Protocol Adapter\*(R" and \*(L"\s-1TCP/IP\s0
Protocol Adapter\*(R".
.PP
If it generates any errors which look relevant then please talk to your
Oracle technical support (and not the dbi-users mailing list).
.SS "Connecting using a bequeather"
.IX Subsection "Connecting using a bequeather"
If you are using a bequeather to connect to a server
on the same host as the client, you might have 
to add
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    bequeath_detach = yes
.Ve
.PP
to your sqlnet.ora file or you won't be able to safely use fork/system
functions in Perl.
.PP

<http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.dbi.dev/2012/02/msg6837.html>

.SH "USING THE LONG TYPES"
.IX Header "USING THE LONG TYPES"
Some examples related to the use of \s-1LONG\s0 types are available in
the \f(CW\*(C`examples/\*(C'\fR directory of the distribution.
.SH "Can't find \fIlibclntsh.so\fP"
.IX Header "Can't find libclntsh.so"
\&\fIlibclntsh.so\fR is the shared
library composed of all the other Oracle libs you used to have to
statically link.
libclntsh.so should be in \fI\f(CI$ORACLE_HOME\fI/lib\fR.  If it's missing, try
running \fI\f(CI$ORACLE_HOME\fI/lib/genclntsh.sh\fR and it should create it.
.PP
Never copy \fIlibclntsh.so\fR to a different machine or Oracle version.
If DBD::Oracle was built on a machine with a different path to \fIlibclntsh.so\fR
then you'll need to set an environment variable, typically
\&\fI\s-1LD_LIBRARY_PATH\s0\fR, to include the directory containing \fIlibclntsh.so\fR.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1LD_LIBRARY_PATH\s0\fR is typically ignored if the script is running set-uid
(which is common in some httpd/CGI configurations).  In this case
either rebuild with \fI\s-1LD_RUN_PATH\s0\fR set to include the path to \fIlibclntsh\fR
or create a symbolic link so that \fIlibclntsh\fR is available via the same
path as it was when the module was built. (On Solaris the command
\&\*(L"ldd \-s Oracle.so\*(R" can be used to see how the linker is searching for it.)

See \s-1RT 72989 \s0(https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=72989)
.PP
Apache2 \s-1MPM\s0 Prefork with mod_perl2 will crash if Module::Runtime is
loaded, and an Oracle connection is opened through PerlRequire (before
forking).
.PP
It looks like this was fixed in 0.012 of Module::Runtime.

.IX Subsection "bin_param_inout swapping return values"
See \s-1RT 71819 \s0(https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=71819)
.PP
It seems that in some older versions of Oracle Instant Client
(certainly 10.2.0.4.0) when output parameters are bound with lengths
greater than 3584 the output parameters can be returned in the wrong
placeholders.
.PP
It is reported fixed in Instant Client 11.2.0.2.0.

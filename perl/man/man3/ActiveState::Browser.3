.SH "NAME"
ActiveState::Browser \- Interface to invoke the web\-browser
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 2
\&  use ActiveState::Browser;
\&  ActiveState::Browser::open("http://www.activestate.com");
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The ActiveState::Browser module provides an interface to make a web browser
pop up showing some \s-1URL\s0 or file.  The following functions are
provided:
.ie n .IP "open( $url )" 4
.el .IP "open( \f(CW$url\fR )" 4
.IX Item "open( $url )"
This will try to open up a web browser displaying the given \s-1URL. \s0 The
function will croak if the \f(CW$url\fR can't be resolved or if no suitable
browser could be found.  The \fIcan_open()\fR test can be used to protect
against such failure, but note that such a test is not race-proof.
.Sp
If the \f(CW$url\fR is absolute it is passed directly to the browser.
.Sp
If the \f(CW$url\fR is relative it is looked up relative to the directory
\&\f(CW$ActiveState::Browser::HTML_DIR\fR, which defaults to the current
directory.
.ie n .IP "can_open( $url )" 4
.el .IP "can_open( \f(CW$url\fR )" 4
.IX Item "can_open( $url )"
Will return \s-1TRUE\s0 if we can invoke a browser for the given \s-1URL. \s0 If the
\&\s-1URL\s0 is not to a local file, then this always returns \s-1TRUE,\s0 given that
a browser program was found.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
The \s-1AS_BROWSER\s0 environment variable can be set to override what
browser to use.  The string \f(CW%s\fR will be replaced with the \s-1URL\s0 to
open.  If no \f(CW%s\fR is present the string is taken as a command to invoke
with the \s-1URL\s0 as the only argument.
.PP
The \f(CW%s\fR template was inspired by the \s-1BROWSER\s0 environment variable
suggestion that appear quite dead; see
<http://www.catb.org/~esr/BROWSER/>.  Note that the \s-1AS_BROWSER\s0 is
\&\fBnot\fR a colon separated list.
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
none.

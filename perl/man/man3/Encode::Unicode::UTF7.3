.SH "ABSTRACT"
.IX Header "ABSTRACT"
This module implements \s-1UTF\-7\s0 encoding documented in \s-1RFC 2152.  UTF\-7,\s0
as its name suggests, is a 7\-bit re-encoded version of \s-1UTF\-16BE. \s0 It
is designed to be MTA-safe and expected to be a standard way to
exchange Unicoded mails via mails.  But with the advent of \s-1UTF\-8\s0 and
8\-bit compliant MTAs, \s-1UTF\-7\s0 is hardly ever used.
.PP
\&\s-1UTF\-7\s0 was not supported by Encode until version 1.95 because of that.
But Unicode::String, a module by Gisle Aas which adds Unicode supports
to non\-utf8\-savvy perl did support \s-1UTF\-7,\s0 the \s-1UTF\-7\s0 support was added
so Encode can supersede Unicode::String 100%.
.SH "In Practice"
.IX Header "In Practice"
When you want to encode Unicode for mails and web pages, however, do
not use \s-1UTF\-7\s0 unless you are sure your recipients and readers can
handle it.  Very few MUAs and \s-1WWW\s0 Browsers support these days (only
Mozilla seems to support one).  For general cases, use \s-1UTF\-8\s0 for
message body and MIME-Header for header instead.

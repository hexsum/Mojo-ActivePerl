.IX Header "JavaScript"
.SS "I have this web page that has JavaScript on it, and my Mech program doesn't work."
.IX Subsection "I have this web page that has JavaScript on it, and my Mech program doesn't work."
That's because WWW::Mechanize doesn't operate on the JavaScript.  It only
understands the \s-1HTML\s0 parts of the page.
.SS "I thought Mech was supposed to work like a web browser."
.IX Subsection "I thought Mech was supposed to work like a web browser."
It does pretty much, but it doesn't support JavaScript.
.PP
I added some basic attempts at picking up URLs in \f(CW\*(C`window.open()\*(C'\fR
calls and return them in \f(CW\*(C`$mech\->links\*(C'\fR.  They work sometimes.
.PP
Since Javascript is completely visible to the client, it cannot be used
to prevent a scraper from following links. But it can make life difficult. If
you want to scrape specific pages, then a solution is always possible.
.PP
One typical use of Javascript is to perform argument checking before
posting to the server. The \s-1URL\s0 you want is probably just buried in the
Javascript function. Do a regular expression match on
\&\f(CW\*(C`$mech\->content()\*(C'\fR
to find the link that you want and \f(CW\*(C`$mech\->get\*(C'\fR it directly (this
assumes that you know what you are looking for in advance).
.PP
In more difficult cases, the Javascript is used for \s-1URL\s0 mangling to
satisfy the needs of some middleware. In this case you need to figure
out what the Javascript is doing (why are these URLs always really
long?). There is probably some function with one or more arguments which
calculates the new \s-1URL.\s0 Step one: using your favorite browser, get the
before and after URLs and save them to files. Edit each file, converting
the argument separators ('?', '&' or ';') into newlines. Now it is
easy to use diff or comm to find out what Javascript did to the \s-1URL.\s0
Step 2 \- find the function call which created the \s-1URL \-\s0 you will need
to parse and interpret its argument list. The Javascript Debugger in the
Firebug extension for Firefox helps with the analysis. At this point, it is
fairly trivial to write your own function which emulates the Javascript
for the pages you want to process.
.PP
Here's another approach that answers the question, \*(L"It works in Firefox,
but why not Mech?\*(R"  Everything the web server knows about the client is
present in the \s-1HTTP\s0 request. If two requests are identical, the results
should be identical. So the real question is \*(L"What is different between
the mech request and the Firefox request?\*(R"
.PP
The Firefox extension \*(L"Tamper Data\*(R" is an effective tool for examining
the headers of the requests to the server. Compare that with what \s-1LWP\s0
is sending. Once the two are identical, the action of the server should
be the same as well.
.PP
I say \*(L"should\*(R", because this is an oversimplification \- some values
are naturally unique, e.g. a SessionID, but if a SessionID is present,
that is probably sufficient, even though the value will be different
between the \s-1LWP\s0 request and the Firefox request. The server could use
the session to store information which is troublesome, but that's not
the first place to look (and highly unlikely to be relevant when you
are requesting the login page of your site).
.PP
Generally the problem is to be found in missing or incorrect \s-1POSTDATA\s0
arguments, Cookies, User-Agents, Accepts, etc. If you are using mech,
then redirects and cookies should not be a problem, but are listed here
for completeness. If you are missing headers, \f(CW\*(C`$mech\->add_header\*(C'\fR
can be used to add the headers that you need.

If you have duplicate names, this method won't work, and you'll

.PP
Or you can set \f(CW\*(C`max_redirect\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $mech\->max_redirect( 0 );
.Ve
.PP
Both these options can also be set in the constructor.  Mech doesn't
understand them, so will pass them through to the LWP::UserAgent
constructor.

.IX Header "Why doesn't this work: Debugging your Mechanize program"
.SS "My Mech program doesn't work, but it works in the browser."
.IX Subsection "My Mech program doesn't work, but it works in the browser."
Mechanize acts like a browser, but apparently something you're doing
is not matching the browser's behavior.  Maybe it's expecting a
certain web client, or maybe you've not handling a field properly.
For some reason, your Mech problem isn't doing exactly what the
browser is doing, and when you find that, you'll have the answer.
.SS "My Mech program gets these 500 errors."
.IX Subsection "My Mech program gets these 500 errors."
A 500 error from the web server says that the program on the server
side died.  Probably the web server program was expecting certain
inputs that you didn't supply, and instead of handling it nicely,
the program died.
.PP
Whatever the cause of the 500 error, if it works in the browser,
but not in your Mech program, you're not acting like the browser.
See the previous question.
.SS "Why doesn't my program handle this form correctly?"

Run \fImech-dump\fR on your page and see what it says.
.PP
\&\fImech-dump\fR is a marvelous diagnostic tool for figuring out what forms

First, make sure that you actually mean to change the field that you're

set by the site you're working on for a reason.  If you change the value,
you might be breaking some functionality by faking it out.

and the \f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR call fails for some reason, then the Mech internals

.IX Subsection "How do I figure out why $mech->get($url) doesn't work?"
There are many reasons why a \f(CW\*(C`get()\*(C'\fR can fail. The server can take
you to someplace you didn't expect. It can generate redirects which are
not properly handled. You can get time-outs. Servers are down more often
than you think! etc, etc, etc. A couple of places to start:
.ie n .IP "1 Check ""$mech\->status()"" after each call" 4
.el .IP "1 Check \f(CW$mech\->status()\fR after each call" 4
.IX Item "1 Check $mech->status() after each call"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "2 Check the \s-1URL\s0 with ""$mech\->uri()"" to see where you ended up" 4
.el .IP "2 Check the \s-1URL\s0 with \f(CW$mech\->uri()\fR to see where you ended up" 4
.IX Item "2 Check the URL with $mech->uri() to see where you ended up"
.ie n .IP "3 Try debugging with ""LWP::Debug""." 4
.el .IP "3 Try debugging with \f(CWLWP::Debug\fR." 4
.IX Item "3 Try debugging with LWP::Debug."
.PD
.PP
If things are really strange, turn on debugging with
\&\f(CW\*(C`use LWP::Debug qw(+);\*(C'\fR
Just put this in the main program. This causes \s-1LWP\s0 to print out a trace
of the \s-1HTTP\s0 traffic between client and server and can be used to figure
out what is happening at the protocol level.
.PP
It is also useful to set many traps to verify that processing is
proceeding as expected. A Mech program should always have an \*(L"I didn't
expect to get here\*(R" or \*(L"I don't recognize the page that I am processing\*(R"
case and bail out.
.PP
Since errors can be transient, by the time you notice that the error
has occurred, it might not be possible to reproduce it manually. So
for automated processing it is useful to email yourself the following
information:
.IP "\(bu" 4
where processing is taking place
.IP "\(bu" 4

.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW$mech\fR\->uri
.IP "\(bu" 4

.SS "I submitted a form, but the server ignored everything!  I got an empty form back!"
.IX Subsection "I submitted a form, but the server ignored everything! I got an empty form back!"
The post is handled by application software. It is common for \s-1PHP\s0
programmers to use the same file both to display a form and to process
the arguments returned. So the first task of the application programmer
is to decide whether there are arguments to processes. The program can
check whether a particular parameter has been set, whether a hidden
parameter has been set, or whether the submit button has been clicked.
(There are probably other ways that I haven't thought of).
.PP
In any case, if your form is not setting the parameter (e.g. the submit
button) which the web application is keying on (and as an outsider there
is no way to know what it is keying on), it will not notice that the form
has been submitted. Try using \f(CW\*(C`$mech\->click()\*(C'\fR instead of
\&\f(CW\*(C`$mech\->submit()\*(C'\fR or vice-versa.
.SS "I've logged in to the server, but I get 500 errors when I try to get to protected content."
.IX Subsection "I've logged in to the server, but I get 500 errors when I try to get to protected content."
Some web sites use distributed databases for their processing. It
can take a few seconds for the login/session information to percolate
through to all the servers. For human users with their slow reaction
times, this is not a problem, but a Perl script can outrun the server.
So try adding a \f(CWsleep(5)\fR between logging in and actually doing anything
(the optimal delay must be determined experimentally).

.IX Item "ORA_OCI"
Oracle doesn't provide a formal \s-1API\s0 for determining the exact version
number of the \s-1OCI\s0 client library used, so DBD::Oracle has to go digging
(and sometimes has to more or less guess).  The \s-1ORA_OCI\s0 constant
holds the result of that process.
.Sp
In string context \s-1ORA_OCI\s0 returns the full \*(L"A.B.C.D\*(R" version string.
.Sp
In numeric context \s-1ORA_OCI\s0 returns the major.minor version number
(8.1, 9.2, 10.0 etc).  But note that version numbers are not actually
floating point and so if Oracle ever makes a release that has a two
digit minor version, such as \f(CW9.10\fR it will have a lower numeric
value than the preceding \f(CW9.9\fR release. So use with care.
.Sp
The contents and format of \s-1ORA_OCI\s0 are subject to change (it may,
for example, become a \fIversion object\fR in later releases).
I recommend that you avoid checking for exact values.

.SH "DBI CLASS METHODS"
.IX Header "DBI CLASS METHODS"
.SS "\fBconnect\fP"
.IX Subsection "connect"
This method creates a database handle by connecting to a database, and is the \s-1DBI\s0 equivalent of the \*(L"new\*(R" method.
To open a connection to an Oracle database you need to specify a database connection string (\s-1URL\s0), username and password.
.PP
The connection string is always of the form: \*(L"dbi:Oracle:<db identifier>\*(R"
There are several ways to identify a database:
.IP "1." 4
If the database is local, specifying the \s-1SID\s0 or service name will be enough.
.IP "2." 4
If the database is defined in a \s-1TNSNAMES.ORA\s0 file, you can use the service name given in the file
.IP "3." 4
To connect without \s-1TNSNAMES.ORA\s0 file, you can use an \s-1EZCONNECT\s0 url, of the form:
//host[:port][/service_name]
.PP
If port name is not specified, 1521 is the default. If service name is not specified, the hostname will be used as a service name.
.PP
The following examples show several ways a connection can be created:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect(\*(Aqdbi:Oracle:DB\*(Aq,\*(Aqusername\*(Aq,\*(Aqpassword\*(Aq);
\&
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect(\*(Aqdbi:Oracle:DB\*(Aq,\*(Aqusername/password\*(Aq,\*(Aq\*(Aq);
\&
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect(\*(Aqdbi:Oracle:\*(Aq,\*(Aqusername@DB\*(Aq,\*(Aqpassword\*(Aq);
\&
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect(\*(Aqdbi:Oracle:host=foobar;sid=DB;port=1521\*(Aq, \*(Aqscott/tiger\*(Aq, \*(Aq\*(Aq);
\&
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect("dbi:Oracle://myhost:1522/ORCL",\*(Aqusername\*(Aq, \*(Aqpassword\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
\fI\s-1OS\s0 authentication\fR
.IX Subsection "OS authentication"
.PP
To connect to a local database with a user which has been set up to
authenticate via the \s-1OS \s0(\*(L"\s-1ALTER USER\s0 username \s-1IDENTIFIED EXTERNALLY\*(R"\s0):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect(\*(Aqdbi:Oracle:\*(Aq,\*(Aq/\*(Aq,\*(Aq\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
Note the lack of a connection name (use the \s-1ORACLE_SID\s0 environment
variable). If an explicit \s-1SID\s0 is used you will probably get an \s-1ORA\-01004\s0 error.
.PP
That only works for local databases. (Authentication to remote Oracle
databases using your Unix login name without a password is possible
but it is not secure and not recommended so not documented here.
.PP
\fIOracle Environment Variables\fR
.IX Subsection "Oracle Environment Variables"
.PP
To use \s-1DBD::ORACLE\s0 to connect to an Oracle database, \s-1ORACLE_HOME\s0 environment variable should be set correctly.
In general, the value used should match the version of Oracle that was used to build DBD::Oracle.  If using dynamic linking then \s-1ORACLE_HOME\s0 should match the version of Oracle that will be used to load in the Oracle client libraries (via \s-1LD_LIBRARY_PATH,\s0 ldconfig, or similar on Unix).
.PP
Oracle can use two environment variables to specify default connections: \s-1ORACLE_SID\s0 and \s-1TWO_TASK.\s0
.PP
To use them, specify either a local \s-1SID\s0 or service name, or a service name that is specified in the \s-1TNSNAMES.ORA\s0 file.
.PP
Note that if you have *both* local and remote databases, and you have \s-1ORACLE_SID\s0 *and* \s-1TWO_TASK\s0 set, and you don't specify a fully
qualified connect string on the command line, \s-1TWO_TASK\s0 takes precedence over \s-1ORACLE_SID \s0(i.e. you get connected to remote system).
.PP
It is highly recommended not to rely on environment variables and to always explicitly specify the \s-1SID\s0 in the connection string. This can prevent serious mistakes such as dropping a schema in the wrong database, and generally makes debugging and troubleshooting easier.
.PP
Also remember that depending on the operating system you are using the differing \*(L"\s-1ORACLE\*(R"\s0 environment variables may be case sensitive, so if you are not connecting as you should double check the case of both the variable and its value.
.PP
\fITimezones\fR
.IX Subsection "Timezones"
.PP
If the query is run through SQL*Net (mostly queries that are executed on remote servers), Oracle will return the time zone based on the setting of the \s-1UNIX\s0 environment variable \*(L"\s-1TZ\*(R"\s0 for the user who started the listener.
.PP
If the query is run locally, Oracle will return the time zone based on the \*(L"\s-1TZ\*(R"\s0 environment variable setting of the user running
the query.
.PP
With local queries, you can change the time zone for a particular user by simply changing the setting of \*(L"\s-1TZ\*(R".\s0 To check the current setting,
issue the \s-1UNIX \s0\*(L"date\*(R" command.
.PP
\fIOracle \s-1DRCP\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "Oracle DRCP"
.PP
DBD::Oracle supports \s-1DRCP \s0(Database Resident Connection Pool) so
if you have an 11.2 database and \s-1DRCP\s0 is enabled you can direct
all of your connections to it by adding ':POOLED' to the \s-1SID\s0 or
setting a connection attribute of ora_drcp, or set the SERVER=POOLED
when using a \s-1TNSENTRY\s0 style connection or even by setting an
environment variable \s-1ORA_DRCP. \s0 All of which are demonstrated below;
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect(\*(Aqdbi:Oracle:DB:POOLED\*(Aq,\*(Aqusername\*(Aq,\*(Aqpassword\*(Aq)
\&
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect(\*(Aqdbi:Oracle:\*(Aq,\*(Aqusername@DB:POOLED\*(Aq,\*(Aqpassword\*(Aq)

\&                                                             ora_drcp_min  =>10})
\&
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect(\*(Aqdbi:Oracle:host=foobar;sid=ORCL;port=1521;SERVER=POOLED\*(Aq, \*(Aqscott/tiger\*(Aq, \*(Aq\*(Aq)
\&
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect(\*(Aqdbi:Oracle:\*(Aq, q{scott/tiger@(DESCRIPTION=
\&  (ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST= foobar)(PORT=1521))
\&  (CONNECT_DATA=(SID=ORCL)(SERVER=POOLED)))}, "")
\&
\&  if the ORA_DRCP environment variable is set then just this
\&
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect(\*(Aqdbi:Oracle:DB\*(Aq,\*(Aqusername\*(Aq,\*(Aqpassword\*(Aq)

You can find a white paper on setting up \s-1DRCP\s0 and its advantages at <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/oracledrcp11g\-1\-133381.pdf>.
.PP
Please note that \s-1DRCP\s0 support in DBD::Oracle is relatively new so the
mechanics or its implementation are subject to change.
.PP
\fI\s-1TAF \s0(Transparent Application Failover)\fR
.IX Subsection "TAF (Transparent Application Failover)"
.PP
Transparent Application Failover (\s-1TAF\s0) is the feature in \s-1OCI\s0 that
allows for clients to automatically reconnect to an instance in the
event of a failure of the instance. The reconnect happens
automatically from within the \s-1OCI \s0(Oracle Call Interface) library.
DBD::Oracle now supports a callback function that will fire when a \s-1TAF\s0
event takes place. You may use the callback to inform the
user a failover is taking place or to setup the session again
once the failover has succeeded.
.PP
You will have to set up \s-1TAF\s0 on your instance before you can use this
callback.  You can test your instance to see if you can use \s-1TAF\s0
callback with
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh\->ora_can_taf();
.Ve
.PP
If you try to set up a callback without it being enabled DBD::Oracle
will croak.
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 Currently, you must enable \s-1TAF\s0 during \s-1DBI\s0's connect. However
once enabled you can change the \s-1TAF\s0 settings.
.PP
It is outside the scope of this document to go through all of the
possible \s-1TAF\s0 situations you might want to set up but here is a simple
example:
.PP
The \s-1TNS\s0 entry for the instance has had the following added to the
\&\s-1CONNECT_DATA\s0 section
.PP
.Vb 5
\&   (FAILOVER_MODE=
\&               (TYPE=select)
\&               (METHOD=basic)
\&               (RETRIES=10)
\&               (DELAY=10))
.Ve
.PP
You will also have to create your own perl function that will be
called from the client.  You can name it anything you want and it will
always be passed two parameters, the failover event value and the
failover type.  You can also set a sleep value in case of failover
error and the \s-1OCI\s0 client will sleep for the specified seconds before it
attempts another event.
.PP

The \s-1TAF\s0 types are as follows
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  OCI_FO_SESSION indicates the user has requested only session failover.
\&  OCI_FO_SELECT indicates the user has requested select failover.
\&  OCI_FO_NONE indicates the user has not requested a failover type.
\&  OCI_FO_TXNAL indicates the user has requested a transaction failover.
.Ve
.PP
The \s-1TAF\s0 events are as follows
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  OCI_FO_BEGIN indicates that failover has detected a lost connection and failover is starting.
\&  OCI_FO_END   indicates successful completion of failover.
\&  OCI_FO_ABORT indicates that failover was unsuccessful, and there is no option of retrying.
\&  OCI_FO_ERROR also indicates that failover was unsuccessful, but it gives the application the opportunity to handle the error and retry failover.
\&  OCI_FO_REAUTH indicates that you have multiple authentication handles and failover has occurred after the original authentication. It indicates that a user handle has been re\-authenticated. To find out which, the application checks the OCI_ATTR_SESSION attribute of the service context handle (which is the first parameter).

excessive for most situations but is needed for backward
compatibility.  If you not converting between a \s-1NCS\s0 on the \s-1DB\s0 and the
Client then you might want to set this to 1 to reduce memory usage.

ora_drcp_class
.IX Subsection "ora_drcp_class"
.PP
If you are using \s-1DRCP,\s0 you can set a \s-1CONNECTION_CLASS\s0 for your pools
as well.  As sessions from a \s-1DRCP\s0 cannot be shared by users, you can
use this setting to identify the same user across different
applications. \s-1OCI\s0 will ensure that sessions belonging to a 'class' are
not shared outside the class'.
.PP
The values for ora_drcp_class cannot contain a '*' and must be less
than 1024 characters.
.PP
This value can be also be specified with the \f(CW\*(C`ORA_DRCP_CLASS\*(C'\fR
environment variable.
.PP
ora_drcp_min
.IX Subsection "ora_drcp_min"
.PP
This optional value specifies the minimum number of sessions that are
initially opened.  New sessions are only opened after this value has
been reached.
.PP
The default value is 4 and  any value above 0 is valid.
.PP
Generally, it should be set to the number of concurrent statements the
application is planning or expecting to run.

This value can also be specified with the \f(CW\*(C`ORA_DRCP_MIN\*(C'\fR environment
variable.
.PP
ora_drcp_max
.IX Subsection "ora_drcp_max"
.PP
This optional value specifies the maximum number of sessions that can
be open at one time.  Once reached no more sessions can be opened
until one becomes free. The default value is 40 and any value above 1
is valid.  You should not set this value lower than ora_drcp_min as
that will just waste resources.
.PP
This value can also be specified with the \f(CW\*(C`ORA_DRCP_MAX\*(C'\fR environment
variable.
.PP
ora_drcp_incr
.IX Subsection "ora_drcp_incr"
.PP
This optional value specifies the next increment for sessions to be

ora_taf_function
.IX Subsection "ora_taf_function"
.PP
If your Oracle instance has been configured to use \s-1TAF\s0 events you can
enable the \s-1TAF\s0 callback by setting this option.
.PP
The name of the Perl subroutine (or a code ref from 1.49_00) that will
be called from \s-1OCI\s0 when a \s-1TAF\s0 event occurs. You must supply a perl
function to use the callback and it will always receive at least two
parameters; the failover event value and the failover type. From
1.49_00 the dbh is passed as the third argument. Below is an example
of a \s-1TAF\s0 function
.PP
.Vb 3

This attribute was removed in 1.49_00 as it was redundant. If you want
to sleep between retries simple add a sleep to your callback sub.
.PP
ora_session_mode
.IX Subsection "ora_session_mode"
.PP
The ora_session_mode attribute can be used to connect with \s-1SYSDBA,
SYSOPER, ORA_SYSASM, ORA_SYSBACKUP, ORA_SYSKM\s0 and \s-1ORA_SYSDG\s0 authorization.
The \s-1ORA_SYSDBA, ORA_SYSOPER, ORA_SYSASM, ORA_SYSBACKUP, ORA_SYSKM\s0
and \s-1ORA_SYSDG\s0 constants can be imported using
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use DBD::Oracle qw(:ora_session_modes);
.Ve
.PP
This is one case where setting \s-1ORACLE_SID\s0 may be useful since
connecting as \s-1SYSDBA\s0 or \s-1SYSOPER\s0 via SQL*Net is frequently disabled
for security reasons.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  $dsn = "dbi:Oracle:";       # no dbname here
\&  $ENV{ORACLE_SID} = "orcl";  # set ORACLE_SID as needed
\&  delete $ENV{TWO_TASK};      # make sure TWO_TASK isn\*(Aqt set
\&
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect($dsn, "", "", { ora_session_mode => ORA_SYSDBA });
.Ve
.PP
It has been reported that this only works if \f(CW$dsn\fR does not contain
a \s-1SID\s0 so that Oracle then uses the value of \s-1ORACLE_SID \s0(not
\&\s-1TWO_TASK\s0) environment variable to connect to a local instance. Also
the username and password should be empty, and the user executing the
script needs to be part of the dba group or osdba group.
.PP
ora_oratab_orahome
.IX Subsection "ora_oratab_orahome"
.PP
Passing a true value for the ora_oratab_orahome attribute will make
DBD::Oracle change \f(CW$ENV{ORACLE_HOME}\fR to make the Oracle home directory
that specified in the \f(CW\*(C`/etc/oratab\*(C'\fR file \fIif\fR the database to connect to
is specified as a \s-1SID\s0 that exists in the oratab file, and DBD::Oracle was
built to use the Oracle 7 \s-1OCI API \s0(not Oracle 8+).
.PP
ora_module_name
.IX Subsection "ora_module_name"
.PP
After connecting to the database the value of this attribute is passed
to the \s-1\fISET_MODULE\s0()\fR function in the \f(CW\*(C`DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO\*(C'\fR \s-1PL/SQL\s0
package. This can be used to identify the application to the \s-1DBA\s0 for
monitoring and performance tuning purposes. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  my $dbh = DBI\->connect($dsn, $user, $passwd, { ora_module_name => $0 });
\&
\&  $dbh\->{ora_module_name} = $y;
.Ve
.PP
The maximum size is 48 bytes.
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 You will need an Oracle client 10.1 or later to use this.
.PP
ora_driver_name
.IX Subsection "ora_driver_name"
.PP
For 11g and later you can now set the name of the driver layer using \s-1OCI.\s0
Perl, Perl5, ApachePerl so on. Names starting with \*(L"\s-1ORA\*(R"\s0 are reserved. You
can enter up to 8 characters.  If none is enter then this will default to
DBDOxxxx where xxxx is the current version number. This value can be
retrieved on the server side using V$SESSION_CONNECT_INFO or
\&\s-1GV$SESSION_CONNECT_INFO\s0
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  my $dbh = DBI\->connect($dsn, $user, $passwd, { ora_driver_name => \*(AqModPerl_1\*(Aq });
\&

.Ve
.PP
ora_client_info
.IX Subsection "ora_client_info"
.PP
Allows you to add any value (up to 64 bytes) to your session and it can be
retrieved on the server side from the \f(CW\*(C`V$SESSION\*(C'\fRa view.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  my $dbh = DBI\->connect($dsn, $user, $passwd, { ora_client_info => \*(AqRemote2\*(Aq });

.PP
ora_client_identifier
.IX Subsection "ora_client_identifier"
.PP
Allows you to specify the user identifier in the session handle.
.PP
Most useful for web applications as it can pass in the session user
name which might be different to the connection user name. Can be up
to 64 bytes long but do not to include the password for security
reasons and the first character of the identifier should not be
\&':'. This value can be retrieved on the server side using \f(CW\*(C`V$SESSION\*(C'\fR
view.
.PP
.Vb 1

.PP
ora_dbh_share
.IX Subsection "ora_dbh_share"
.PP
Requires at least Perl 5.8.0 compiled with ithreads.
.PP
Allows you to share
database connections between threads. The first connect will make the
connection, all following calls to connect with the same ora_dbh_share
attribute will use the same database connection. The value must be a
reference to a already shared scalar which is initialized to an empty
string.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  our $orashr : shared = \*(Aq\*(Aq ;
\&
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect ($dsn, $user, $passwd, {ora_dbh_share => \e$orashr}) ;
.Ve
.PP
ora_envhp
.IX Subsection "ora_envhp"
.PP
The first time a connection is made a new \s-1OCI \s0'environment' is
created by DBD::Oracle and stored in the driver handle.
Subsequent connects reuse (share) that same \s-1OCI\s0 environment
by default.
.PP
The ora_envhp attribute can be used to disable the reuse of the \s-1OCI\s0
environment from a previous connect. If the value is \f(CW0\fR then
a new \s-1OCI\s0 environment is allocated and used for this connection.
.PP
The \s-1OCI\s0 environment holds information about the client side context,
such as the local \s-1NLS\s0 environment. By altering \f(CW%ENV\fR and setting
ora_envhp to 0 you can create connections with different \s-1NLS\s0
settings. This is most useful for testing.
.PP
ora_charset, ora_ncharset
.IX Subsection "ora_charset, ora_ncharset"
.PP
For oracle versions >= 9.2 you can specify the client charset and
ncharset with the ora_charset and ora_ncharset attributes.  You
still need to pass \f(CW\*(C`ora_envhp = 0\*(C'\fR for all but the first connect.
.PP
These attributes override the settings from environment variables.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect ($dsn, $user, $passwd,
\&                       {ora_charset => \*(AqAL32UTF8\*(Aq});
.Ve
.PP
ora_verbose
.IX Subsection "ora_verbose"
.PP
Use this value to enable DBD::Oracle only tracing.  Simply either set
the ora_verbose attribute on the \fIconnect()\fR method to the trace level
you desire like this
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  my $dbh = DBI\->connect($dsn, "", "", {ora_verbose=>6});
.Ve
.PP
or set it directly on the \s-1DB\s0 handle like this;
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh\->{ora_verbose} =6;
.Ve
.PP
In both cases the DBD::Oracle trace level is set to 6, which is the highest
level tracing most of the calls to \s-1OCI.\s0
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 In future versions of DBD::Oracle ora_verbose will be changed so
that it is simply a switch to turn \s-1DBI\s0's \s-1DBD\s0 tracing on or off.  A
true value will turn it on and a false value will turn it off.  \s-1DBI\s0's
\&\*(L"\s-1DBD\*(R"\s0 tracing was not available when ora_verbose was created and
ora_verbose adds an additional test to every trace test.
.PP
ora_oci_success_warn
.IX Subsection "ora_oci_success_warn"
.PP
Use this value to print otherwise silent \s-1OCI\s0 warnings that may happen
when an execute or fetch returns \*(L"Success With Info\*(R" or when you want
to tune RowCaching and \s-1LOB\s0 Reads
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh\->{ora_oci_success_warn} = 1;
.Ve
.PP
ora_objects
.IX Subsection "ora_objects"
.PP
Use this value to enable extended embedded oracle objects mode. In extended:
.IP "1." 4
Embedded objects are returned as <DBD::Oracle::Object> instance (including type-name etc.) instead of simple \s-1ARRAY.\s0
.IP "2." 4
Determine object type for each instance. All object attributes are returned (not only super-type's attributes).
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh\->{ora_objects} = 1;
.Ve
.PP
ora_ph_type
.IX Subsection "ora_ph_type"
.PP
The default placeholder datatype for the database session.
The \f(CW\*(C`TYPE\*(C'\fR or \*(L"ora_type\*(R" attributes to \*(L"bind_param\*(R" in \s-1DBI\s0 and
\&\*(L"bind_param_inout\*(R" in \s-1DBI\s0 override the datatype for individual placeholders.
The most frequent reason for using this attribute is to permit trailing spaces
in values passed by placeholders.
.PP
Constants for the values allowed for this attribute can be imported using
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use DBD::Oracle qw(:ora_types);
.Ve
.PP
Only the following values are permitted for this attribute.
.IP "\s-1ORA_VARCHAR2\s0" 4
.IX Item "ORA_VARCHAR2"
Oracle clients using \s-1OCI 8\s0 will strip trailing spaces and allow embedded \e0 bytes.
Oracle clients using \s-1OCI 9.2\s0 do not strip trailing spaces and allow embedded \e0 bytes.
This is the normal default placeholder type.
.IP "\s-1ORA_STRING\s0" 4
.IX Item "ORA_STRING"
Do not strip trailing spaces and end the string at the first \e0.
.IP "\s-1ORA_CHAR\s0" 4
.IX Item "ORA_CHAR"
Do not strip trailing spaces and allow embedded \e0.
Force 'blank\-padded comparison semantics'.
.Sp
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  use DBD::Oracle qw(:ora_types);
\&
\&  $SQL="select username from all_users where username = ?";
\&  #username is a char(8)
\&  $sth=$dbh\->prepare($SQL)";
\&  $sth\->bind_param(1,\*(Aqbloggs\*(Aq,{ ora_type => ORA_CHAR});
.Ve
.Sp
Will pad bloggs out to 8 characters and return the username.
.PP
ora_parse_error_offset
.IX Subsection "ora_parse_error_offset"
.PP
If the previous error was from a failed \f(CW\*(C`prepare\*(C'\fR due to a syntax error,
this attribute gives the offset into the \f(CW\*(C`Statement\*(C'\fR attribute where the
error was found.
.PP
ora_array_chunk_size
.IX Subsection "ora_array_chunk_size"
.PP
Due to \s-1OCI\s0 limitations, DBD::Oracle needs to buffer up rows of
bind values in its \f(CW\*(C`execute_for_fetch\*(C'\fR implementation. This attribute
sets the number of rows to buffer at a time (default value is 1000).
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`execute_for_fetch\*(C'\fR function will collect (at most) this many
rows in an array, send them off to the \s-1DB\s0 for execution, then go back
to collect the next chunk of rows and so on. This attribute can be
used to limit or extend the number of rows processed at a time.
.PP
Note that this attribute also applies to \f(CW\*(C`execute_array\*(C'\fR, since that
method is implemented using \f(CW\*(C`execute_for_fetch\*(C'\fR.
.PP
ora_connect_with_default_signals
.IX Subsection "ora_connect_with_default_signals"
.PP
Sometimes the Oracle client seems to change some of the signal
handlers of the process during the connect phase.  For instance, some
users have observed Perl's default \f(CW$SIG{INT}\fR handler being ignored
after connecting to an Oracle database.  If this causes problems in
your application, set this attribute to an array reference of signals
you would like to be localized during the connect process.  Once the
connect is complete, the signal handlers should be returned to their
previous state.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect ($dsn, $user, $passwd,
\&                       {ora_connect_with_default_signals => [ \*(AqINT\*(Aq ] });
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE\s0 disabling the signal handlers the \s-1OCI\s0 library sets up may affect
functionality in the \s-1OCI\s0 library.
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE\s0 If you are using connect_cached then the above example will lead
to \s-1DBI\s0 thinking each connection is different as an anonymous array reference
is being used. To avoid this when using connect_cached you are advised
to use:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  my @ora_default_signals = (...);
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect($dsn, $user, $passwd,
\&      {ora_connect_with_default_signals => \e@ora_default_signals});
.Ve

.SS "\fBRaiseError\fP (boolean, inherited)"
.IX Subsection "RaiseError (boolean, inherited)"
Forces errors to always raise an exception. Although it defaults to off, it is recommended that this
be turned on, as the alternative is to check the return value of every method (prepare, execute, fetch, etc.)
manually, which is easy to forget to do.
.SS "\fBPrintError\fP (boolean, inherited)"
.IX Subsection "PrintError (boolean, inherited)"
Forces database errors to also generate warnings, which can then be filtered with methods such as

Enables warnings. This is on by default, and should only be turned off in a local block
for a short a time only when absolutely needed.
.SS "\fBExecuted\fP (boolean, read-only)"
.IX Subsection "Executed (boolean, read-only)"
Indicates if a handle has been executed. For database handles, this value is true after the \*(L"do\*(R" method has been called, or
when one of the child statement handles has issued an \*(L"execute\*(R". Issuing a \*(L"commit\*(R" or \*(L"rollback\*(R" always resets the
attribute to false for database handles. For statement handles, any call to \*(L"execute\*(R" or its variants will flip the value to
true for the lifetime of the statement handle.
.SS "\fBTraceLevel\fP (integer, inherited)"
.IX Subsection "TraceLevel (integer, inherited)"
Sets the trace level, similar to the \*(L"trace\*(R" method. See the sections on

or not. Use of this attribute is not encouraged.
.SS "\fBKids\fP (integer, read-only)"
.IX Subsection "Kids (integer, read-only)"
Returns the number of child processes created for each handle type. For a driver handle, indicates the number

The CompatMode attribute is used by emulation layers (such as Oraperl) to enable compatible behaviour in the underlying driver (e.g., DBD::Oracle) for this handle. Not normally set by application code.
.PP
It also has the effect of disabling the 'quick \s-1FETCH\s0' of attribute values from the handles attribute cache. So all attribute values are handled by the drivers own \s-1FETCH\s0 method. This makes them slightly slower but is useful for special-purpose drivers like DBD::Multiplex.

.PP
\fI\f(BIPlaceholders\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "Placeholders"
.PP
There are three types of placeholders that can be used in
DBD::Oracle.
.PP
The first is the \*(L"question mark\*(R" type, in which each placeholder is
represented by a single question mark character. This is the method
recommended by the \s-1DBI\s0 and is the most portable. Each question
mark is internally replaced by a \*(L"dollar sign number\*(R" in the order in
which they appear in the query (important when using \*(L"bind_param\*(R").
.PP
The second type of placeholder is \*(L"named parameters\*(R" in the format
\&\*(L":foo\*(R" which is the one Oracle prefers.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&   $dbh\->{RaiseError} = 1;        # save having to check each method call
\&   $sth = $dbh\->prepare("SELECT name, age FROM people WHERE name LIKE :name");
\&   $sth\->bind_param(\*(Aq:name\*(Aq, "John%");
\&   $sth\->execute;
\&   DBI::dump_results($sth);
.Ve
.PP
Note when calling bind_param with named parameters you must include
the leading colon. The advantage of this placeholder type is that you
can use the same placeholder more than once in the same \s-1SQL\s0 statement
but you only need to bind it once.
.PP
The last placeholder type is a variation of the two above where you
name each placeholder :N (where N is a number). Like the named
placeholders above you can use the same placeholder multiple times in
the \s-1SQL\s0 but when you call bind_param you only need to pass the N
(e.g., for :1 you use bind_param(1,...) and not bind_param(':1',...).
.PP
The different types of placeholders cannot be mixed within a statement, but you may
use different ones for each statement handle you have. This is confusing at best, so
stick to one style within your program.
.SS "\fBprepare_cached\fP"
.IX Subsection "prepare_cached"
.Vb 1
\&  $sth = $dbh\->prepare_cached($statement, \e%attr);
.Ve
.PP
Implemented by \s-1DBI,\s0 no driver-specific impact. This method is most useful
if the same query is used over and over as it will cut down round trips to the server.
.SS "\fBdo\fP"
.IX Subsection "do"
.Vb 3
\&  $rv = $dbh\->do($statement);
\&  $rv = $dbh\->do($statement, \e%attr);
\&  $rv = $dbh\->do($statement, \e%attr, @bind_values);
.Ve
.PP
Prepare and execute a single statement. Returns the number of rows affected if the
query was successful, returns undef if an error occurred, and returns \-1 if the
number of rows is unknown or not available. Note that this method will return \fB0E0\fR instead
of 0 for 'no rows were affected', in order to always return a true value if no error occurred.
.SS "\fBlast_insert_id\fP"
.IX Subsection "last_insert_id"
Oracle does not implement auto_increment of serial type columns it uses predefined
sequences where the id numbers are either selected before insert, at insert time with a trigger,
 or as part of the query.
.PP
Below is an example of you to use the latter with the \s-1SQL\s0 returning clause to get the \s-1ID\s0 number back
on insert with the bind_param_inout method.

Issues a \s-1COMMIT\s0 to the server, indicating that the current transaction is finished and that
all changes made will be visible to other processes. If AutoCommit is enabled, then
a warning is given and no \s-1COMMIT\s0 is issued. Returns true on success, false on error.
.SS "\fBrollback\fP"
.IX Subsection "rollback"
.Vb 1
\&  $rv = $dbh\->rollback;
.Ve
.PP
Issues a \s-1ROLLBACK\s0 to the server, which discards any changes made in the current transaction. If AutoCommit
is enabled, then a warning is given and no \s-1ROLLBACK\s0 is issued. Returns true on success, and
false on error.
.SS "\fBbegin_work\fP"
.IX Subsection "begin_work"
This method turns on transactions until the next call to \*(L"commit\*(R" or \*(L"rollback\*(R", if \*(L"AutoCommit\*(R" is
currently enabled. If it is not enabled, calling begin_work will issue an error. Note that the
transaction will not actually begin until the first statement after begin_work is called.
.SS "\fBdisconnect\fP"
.IX Subsection "disconnect"
.Vb 1
\&  $rv = $dbh\->disconnect;
.Ve
.PP
Disconnects from the Oracle database. Any uncommitted changes will be rolled back upon disconnection. It's
good policy to always explicitly call commit or rollback at some point before disconnecting, rather than
relying on the default rollback behavior.
.PP
If the script exits before disconnect is called (or, more precisely, if the database handle is no longer
referenced by anything), then the database handle's \s-1DESTROY\s0 method will call the \fIrollback()\fR and \fIdisconnect()\fR
methods automatically. It is best to explicitly disconnect rather than rely on this behavior.

.SS "\fBRowCacheSize\fP"
.IX Subsection "RowCacheSize"
DBD::Oracle supports both Server pre-fetch and Client side row caching. By default both
are turned on to give optimum performance. Most of the time one can just let DBD::Oracle
figure out the best optimization.
.PP
\fI\f(BIRow Caching\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "Row Caching"
.PP
Row caching occurs on the client side and the object of it is to cut down the number of round
trips made to the server when fetching rows. At each fetch a set number of rows will be retrieved
from the server and stored locally. Further calls the server are made only when the end of the
local buffer(cache) is reached.
.PP
Rows up to the specified top level row
count \f(CW\*(C`RowCacheSize\*(C'\fR are fetched if it occupies no more than the specified memory usage limit.
The default value is 0, which means that memory size is not included in computing the number of rows to prefetch. If
the \f(CW\*(C`RowCacheSize\*(C'\fR value is set to a negative number then the positive value of RowCacheSize is used
to compute the number of rows to prefetch.
.PP
By default \f(CW\*(C`RowCacheSize\*(C'\fR is automatically set. If you want to totally turn off prefetching set this to 1.
.PP
For any \s-1SQL\s0 statement that contains a \s-1LOB,\s0 Long or Object Type Row Caching will be turned off. However server side
caching still works.  If you are only selecting a \s-1LOB\s0 Locator then Row Caching will still work.
.PP
\fIRow Prefetching\fR
.IX Subsection "Row Prefetching"
.PP
Row prefetching occurs on the server side and uses the \s-1DBI\s0 database handle attribute \f(CW\*(C`RowCacheSize\*(C'\fR and or the
Prepare Attribute 'ora_prefetch_memory'. Tweaking these values may yield improved performance.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $dbh\->{RowCacheSize} = 100;
\&  $sth=$dbh\->prepare($SQL,{ora_exe_mode=>OCI_STMT_SCROLLABLE_READONLY,ora_prefetch_memory=>10000});
.Ve
.PP
In the above example 10 rows will be prefetched up to a maximum of 10000 bytes of data.  The Oracle Call Interface Programmer's Guide,
suggests a good row cache value for a scrollable cursor is about 20% of expected size of the record set.
.PP
The prefetch settings tell the DBD::Oracle to grab x rows (or x\-bytes) when it needs to get new rows. This happens on the first
fetch that sets the current_positon to any value other than 0. In the above example if we do a \s-1OCI_FETCH_FIRST\s0 the first 10 rows are
loaded into the buffer and DBD::Oracle will not have to go back to the server for more rows. When record 11 is fetched DBD::Oracle
fetches and returns this row and the next 9 rows are loaded into the buffer. In this case if you fetch backwards from 10 to 1
no server round trips are made.
.PP
With large record sets it is best not to attempt to go to the last record as this may take some time, A large buffer size might even slow down
the fetch. If you must get the number of rows in a large record set you might try using an few large OCI_FETCH_ABSOLUTEs and then an \s-1OCI_FETCH_LAST,\s0
this might save some time. So if you had a record set of 10000 rows and you set the buffer to 5000 and did a \s-1OCI_FETCH_LAST\s0 one would fetch the first 5000 rows into the buffer then the next 5000 rows.
If one requires only the first few rows there is no need to set a large prefetch value.
.PP
If the ora_prefetch_memory less than 1 or not present then memory size is not included in computing the
number of rows to prefetch otherwise the number of rows will be limited to memory size. Likewise if the RowCacheSize is less than 1 it
is not included in the computing of the prefetch rows.

.PP
Allows the user to bind a value and/or a data type to a placeholder.
.PP
The value of \f(CW$param_num\fR is a number if using the '?' or if using \*(L":foo\*(R" style placeholders, the complete name
(e.g. \*(L":foo\*(R") must be given.
The \f(CW$bind_value\fR argument is fairly self-explanatory. A value of \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR will
bind a \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR to the placeholder. Using \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is useful when you want
to change just the type and will be overwriting the value later.
(Any value is actually usable, but \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is easy and efficient).
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`\e%attr\*(C'\fR hash is used to indicate the data type of the placeholder.
The default value is \*(L"varchar\*(R". If you need something else, you must
use one of the values provided by \s-1DBI\s0 or by DBD::Pg. To use a \s-1SQL\s0 value,
modify your \*(L"use \s-1DBI\*(R"\s0 statement at the top of your script as follows:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use DBI qw(:sql_types);
.Ve
.PP
This will import some constants into your script. You can plug those
directly into the \*(L"bind_param\*(R" call. Some common ones that you will
encounter are:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  SQL_INTEGER
.Ve
.PP
To use Oracle \s-1SQL\s0 data types, import the list of values like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use DBD::Pg qw(:ora_types);
.Ve
.PP
You can then set the data types by setting the value of the \f(CW\*(C`ora_type\*(C'\fR
key in the hash passed to \*(L"bind_param\*(R".
The current list of Oracle data types exported is:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  ORA_VARCHAR2 ORA_STRING ORA_NUMBER ORA_LONG ORA_ROWID ORA_DATE ORA_RAW
\&  ORA_LONGRAW ORA_CHAR ORA_CHARZ ORA_MLSLABEL ORA_XMLTYPE ORA_CLOB ORA_BLOB
\&  ORA_RSET ORA_VARCHAR2_TABLE ORA_NUMBER_TABLE SQLT_INT SQLT_FLT ORA_OCI
\&  SQLT_CHR SQLT_BIN
.Ve
.PP
Data types are \*(L"sticky,\*(R" in that once a data type is set to a certain placeholder,
it will remain for that placeholder, unless it is explicitly set to something
else afterwards. If the statement has already been prepared, and you switch the
data type to something else, DBD::Oracle will re-prepare the statement for you before
doing the next execute.
.PP
Examples:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  use DBI qw(:sql_types);
\&  use DBD::Pg qw(:ora_types);
\&
\&  $SQL = "SELECT id FROM ptable WHERE size > ? AND title = ?";

\&  $sth\->bind_param(1, undef, SQL_INTEGER);
\&
\&  ## The "undef" bound above is not used, since we supply params to execute
\&  $sth\->execute(123, "Merk");
\&
\&  ## Set the first placeholder\*(Aqs value and data type
\&  $sth\->bind_param(1, 234, { pg_type => ORA_NUMBER });
\&
\&  ## Set the second placeholder\*(Aqs value and data type.
\&  ## We don\*(Aqt send a third argument, so the default "varchar" is used
\&  $sth\->bind_param(\*(Aq$2\*(Aq, "Zool");
\&
\&  ## We realize that the wrong data type was set above, so we change it:
\&  $sth\->bind_param(\*(Aq$1\*(Aq, 234, { pg_type => SQL_INTEGER });
\&
\&  ## We also got the wrong value, so we change that as well.
\&  ## Because the data type is sticky, we don\*(Aqt need to change it
\&  $sth\->bind_param(1, 567);
\&

The DBD::Oracle module can avoid an explicit 'describe' operation
prior to the execution of the statement unless the application requests
information about the results (such as \f(CW$sth\fR\->{\s-1NAME\s0}). This reduces
communication with the server and increases performance (reducing the
number of \s-1PARSE_CALLS\s0 inside the server).

However, it also means that \s-1SQL\s0 errors are not detected until

DBD::Oracle does not currently support binding a \s-1PL/SQL\s0 table (aka array)
as an \s-1IN OUT\s0 parameter to any Perl data structure.  You cannot therefore call
a \s-1PL/SQL\s0 function or procedure from \s-1DBI\s0 that uses a non-atomic datatype as
either a parameter, or a return value.  However, if you are using Oracle 9.0.1
or later, you can make use of table (or pipelined) functions.
.PP
For example, assume you have the existing \s-1PL/SQL\s0 Package :
.PP
.Vb 12
\&  CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE Array_Example AS

\&  END Array_Example ;
\&  /
.Ve
.PP
Currently, there is no way to directly call the function
Array_Example.Array_Func from \s-1DBI. \s0 However, by making the following relatively
painless additions, its not only possible, but extremely efficient.
.PP
First, you need to create database object types that correspond to the record
and table types in the package.  From the above example, these would be :
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE tArray_Example_\|_taRec
\&  AS OBJECT (
\&      Col1    NUMBER,
\&      Col2    VARCHAR2 (10),
\&      Col3    DATE
\&  ) ;
\&
\&  CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE taArray_Example_\|_taRec
\&  AS TABLE OF tArray_Example_\|_taRec ;
.Ve
.PP
Now, assuming the existing function needs to remain unchanged (it is probably
being called from other \s-1PL/SQL\s0 code), we need to add a new function to the
package.  Here's the new package specification and body :
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE Array_Example AS
\&      \-\-
\&      TYPE tRec IS RECORD (
\&          Col1    NUMBER,
\&          Col2    VARCHAR2 (10),
\&          Col3    DATE) ;
\&      \-\-
\&      TYPE taRec IS TABLE OF tRec INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER ;
\&      \-\-
\&      FUNCTION Array_Func RETURN taRec ;
\&      FUNCTION Array_Func_DBI RETURN taArray_Example_\|_taRec PIPELINED ;
\&      \-\-
\&  END Array_Example ;
\&
\&  CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY Array_Example AS
\&  \-\-
\&  FUNCTION Array_Func RETURN taRec AS
\&      l_Ret  taRec ;
\&  BEGIN
\&      FOR i IN 1 .. 5 LOOP
\&          l_Ret (i).Col1 := i ;
\&          l_Ret (i).Col2 := \*(AqRow : \*(Aq || i ;
\&          l_Ret (i).Col3 := TRUNC (SYSDATE) + i ;
\&      END LOOP ;
\&      RETURN l_Ret ;
\&  END ;
\&
\&  FUNCTION Array_Func_DBI RETURN taArray_Example_\|_taRec PIPELINED AS
\&      l_Set  taRec ;
\&  BEGIN
\&      l_Set := Array_Func ;
\&      FOR i IN l_Set.FIRST .. l_Set.LAST LOOP
\&          PIPE ROW (
\&              tArray_Example_\|_taRec (
\&                  l_Set (i).Col1,
\&                  l_Set (i).Col2,
\&                  l_Set (i).Col3
\&              )
\&          ) ;
\&      END LOOP ;
\&      RETURN ;
\&  END ;
\&  \-\-
\&  END Array_Example ;
.Ve
.PP
As you can see, the new function is very simple.  Now, it is a simple matter
of calling the function as a straight-forward \s-1SELECT\s0 from your \s-1DBI\s0 code.  From
the above example, the code would look something like this :
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  my $sth = $dbh\->prepare(\*(AqSELECT * FROM TABLE(Array_Example.Array_Func_DBI)\*(Aq);
\&  $sth\->execute;

Oracle array entries with maximum length 10 of each. So, you can get no more
than 100 array entries with length <= 10.

as maximum length of entry of array bound. If 0 < \fImax_len\fR < length( \f(CW$some_element\fR ),

If you set \fIora_maxarray_numentries\fR to zero, current (at bind time) bound

.SH "SCROLLABLE CURSORS"
.IX Header "SCROLLABLE CURSORS"
Oracle supports the concept of a 'Scrollable Cursor' which is defined as a 'Result Set' where
the rows can be fetched either sequentially or non-sequentially. One can fetch rows forward,
backwards, from any given position or the n\-th row from the current position in the result set.
.PP
Rows are numbered sequentially starting at one and client-side caching of the partial or entire result set
can improve performance by limiting round trips to the server.
.PP
Oracle does not support \s-1DML\s0 type operations with scrollable cursors so you are limited
to simple 'Select' operations only. As well you can not use this functionality with remote
mapped queries or if the \s-1LONG\s0 datatype is part of the select list.
.PP
However, LOBSs, CLOBSs, and BLOBs do work as do all the regular bind, and fetch methods.
.PP
Only use scrollable cursors if you really have a good reason to. They do use up considerable
more server and client resources and have poorer response times than non-scrolling cursors.
.SS "Enabling Scrollable Cursors"
.IX Subsection "Enabling Scrollable Cursors"
To enable this functionality you must first import the 'Fetch Orientation' and the 'Execution Mode' constants by using;
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   use DBD::Oracle qw(:ora_fetch_orient :ora_exe_modes);
.Ve
.PP
Next you will have to tell DBD::Oracle that you will be using scrolling by setting the ora_exe_mode attribute on the
statement handle to '\s-1OCI_STMT_SCROLLABLE_READONLY\s0' with the prepare method;
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $sth=$dbh\->prepare($SQL,{ora_exe_mode=>OCI_STMT_SCROLLABLE_READONLY});
.Ve
.PP
When the statement is executed you will then be able to use 'ora_fetch_scroll' method to get a row
or you can still use any of the other fetch methods but with a poorer response time than if you used a
non-scrolling cursor. As well scrollable cursors are compatible with any applicable bind methods.

.SH "LOBS AND LONGS"
.IX Header "LOBS AND LONGS"
The key to working with LOBs (\s-1CLOB,\s0 BLOBs) is to remember the value of an Oracle \s-1LOB\s0 column is not the content of the \s-1LOB.\s0 It's a
\&'\s-1LOB\s0 Locator' which, after being selected or inserted needs extra processing to read or write the content of the \s-1LOB.\s0 There are also legacy \s-1LONG\s0 types (\s-1LONG, LONG RAW, VARCHAR2\s0)
which are presently deprecated by Oracle but are still in use.  These \s-1LONG\s0 types do not utilize a '\s-1LOB\s0 Locator' and also are more limited in
functionality than \s-1CLOB\s0 or \s-1BLOB\s0 fields.
.PP
DBD::Oracle now offers three interfaces to \s-1LOB\s0 and \s-1LONG\s0 data,
.ie n .IP """Data Interface for Persistent LOBs""" 4
.el .IP "``Data Interface for Persistent LOBs''" 4
.IX Item "Data Interface for Persistent LOBs"
With this interface DBD::Oracle handles your data directly utilizing regular \s-1OCI\s0 calls, Oracle itself takes care of the \s-1LOB\s0 Locator operations in the case of
BLOBs and CLOBs treating them exactly as if they were the same as the legacy \s-1LONG\s0 or \s-1LONG RAW\s0 types.
.ie n .IP """Data Interface for \s-1LOB\s0 Locators""" 4
.el .IP "``Data Interface for \s-1LOB\s0 Locators''" 4
.IX Item "Data Interface for LOB Locators"
With this interface DBD::Oracle handles your data utilizing \s-1LOB\s0 Locator \s-1OCI\s0 calls so it only works with \s-1CLOB\s0 and \s-1BLOB\s0 datatypes. With this interface DBD::Oracle takes care of the \s-1LOB\s0 Locator operations for you.
.ie n .IP """\s-1LOB\s0 Locator Method Interface""" 4
.el .IP "``\s-1LOB\s0 Locator Method Interface''" 4
.IX Item "LOB Locator Method Interface"
This allows the user direct access to the \s-1LOB\s0 Locator methods, so you have to take case of the \s-1LOB\s0 Locator operations yourself.
.PP
Generally speaking the interface that you will chose will be dependent on what end you are trying to achieve. All have their benefits and
drawbacks.
.PP
One point to remember when working with LOBs (CLOBs, BLOBs) is if your \s-1LOB\s0 column can be in one of three states;
.IP "\s-1NULL\s0" 4
.IX Item "NULL"
The table cell is created, but the cell holds no locator or value.
If your \s-1LOB\s0 field is in this state then there is no \s-1LOB\s0 Locator that DBD::Oracle can work so if your encounter a
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  DBD::Oracle::db::ora_lob_read: locator is not of type OCILobLocatorPtr
.Ve
.Sp
error when working with a \s-1LOB.\s0
.Sp
You can correct this by using an \s-1SQL UPDATE\s0 statement to reset the \s-1LOB\s0 column to a non-NULL (or empty \s-1LOB\s0) value with either \s-1EMPTY_BLOB\s0 or \s-1EMPTY_CLOB\s0 as in this example;
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  UPDATE lob_example
\&     SET bindata=EMPTY_BLOB()
\&   WHERE bindata IS NULL.
.Ve
.IP "Empty" 4
.IX Item "Empty"
A \s-1LOB\s0 instance with a locator exists in the cell, but it has no value. The length of the \s-1LOB\s0 is zero. In this case DBD::Oracle will return 'undef' for the field.
.IP "Populated" 4
.IX Item "Populated"
A \s-1LOB\s0 instance with a locator and a value exists in the cell. You actually get the \s-1LOB\s0 value.
.SS "Data Interface for Persistent LOBs"
.IX Subsection "Data Interface for Persistent LOBs"
This is the original interface for \s-1LONG\s0 and \s-1LONG RAW\s0 datatypes and from Oracle 9iR1 and later the \s-1OCI API\s0 was extended to work directly with the other \s-1LOB\s0 datatypes.
In other words you can treat all \s-1LOB\s0 type data (\s-1BLOB, CLOB\s0) as if it was a \s-1LONG, LONG RAW,\s0 or \s-1VARCHAR2.\s0 So you can perform \s-1INSERT, UPDATE,\s0 fetch, bind, and define operations on LOBs using the same techniques
you would use on other datatypes that store character or binary data. In some cases there are fewer round trips to the server as no '\s-1LOB\s0 Locators' are
used, normally one can get an entire \s-1LOB\s0 is a single round trip.
.PP
\fISimple Fetch for LONGs and \s-1LONG\s0 RAWs\fR
.IX Subsection "Simple Fetch for LONGs and LONG RAWs"
.PP
As the name implies this is the simplest way to use this interface. DBD::Oracle just attempts to get your \s-1LONG\s0 datatypes as a single large piece.
There are no special settings, simply set the database handle's 'LongReadLen' attribute to a value that will be the larger than the expected size of the \s-1LONG\s0 or \s-1LONG RAW.\s0
If the size of the \s-1LONG\s0 or \s-1LONG RAW\s0 exceeds  the 'LongReadLen' DBD::Oracle will return a '\s-1ORA\-24345: A\s0 Truncation' error.  To stop this set the database handle's 'LongTruncOk' attribute to '1'.
The maximum value of 'LongReadLen' seems to be dependent on the physical memory limits of the box that Oracle is running on.  You have most likely reached this limit if you run into
an '\s-1ORA\-01062:\s0 unable to allocate memory for define buffer' error.  One solution is to set the size of 'LongReadLen' to a lower value.
.PP
For example give this table;
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  CREATE TABLE test_long (
\&            id NUMBER,
\&            long1 long)
.Ve
.PP
this code;
.PP
.Vb 8
\&  $dbh\->{LongReadLen} = 2*1024*1024; #2 meg
\&  $SQL=\*(Aqselect p_id,long1 from test_long\*(Aq;
\&  $sth=$dbh\->prepare($SQL);
\&  $sth\->execute();
\&  while (my ( $p_id,$long )=$sth\->fetchrow()){
\&    print "p_id=".$p_id."\en";
\&    print "long=".$long."\en";
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
Will select out all of the long1 fields in the table as long as they are all under 2MB in length. A value in long1 longer than this will throw an error. Adding this line;
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh\->{LongTruncOk}=1;
.Ve
.PP
before the execute will return all the long1 fields but they will be truncated at 2MBs.
.PP
\fIUsing ora_ncs_buff_mtpl\fR
.IX Subsection "Using ora_ncs_buff_mtpl"
.PP
When getting CLOBs and NCLOBs in or out of Oracle, the Server will translate from the Server's NCharSet to the
Client's. If they happen to be the same or at least compatible then all of these actions are a 1 char to 1 char bases.
Thus if you set your LongReadLen buffer to 10_000_000 you will get up to 10_000_000 char.
.PP
However if the Server has to translate from one NCharSet to another it will use bytes for conversion. The buffer
value is set to 4 * \s-1LONG_READ_LEN\s0 which was very wasteful as you might only be asking for 10_000_000 bytes
but you were actually using 40_000_000 bytes of buffer under the hood.  You would still get 10_000_000 bytes
(maybe less characters though) but you are using allot more memory that you need.
.PP
You can now customize the size of the buffer by setting the 'ora_ncs_buff_mtpl' either on the connection or statement handle. You can
also set this as '\s-1ORA_DBD_NCS_BUFFER\s0' \s-1OS\s0 environment variable so you will have to go back and change all your code if you are getting into trouble.
.PP
The default value is still set to 4 for backward compatibility. You can lower this value and thus increase the amount of data you can retrieve. If the
ora_ncs_buff_mtpl is too small DBD::Oracle will throw and error telling you to increase this buffer by one.
.PP
If the error is not captured then you may get at some random point later on, usually at a \fIfinish()\fR or \fIdisconnect()\fR or even a \fIfetch()\fR this error;
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  ORA\-03127: no new operations allowed until the active operation ends
.Ve
.PP
This is one of the more obscure \s-1ORA\s0 errors (have some fun and report it to Meta-Link they will scratch their heads for hours)
.PP
If you get this, simply increment the ora_ncs_buff_mtpl by one until it goes away.
.PP
This should greatly increase your ability to select very large CLOBs or NCLOBs, by freeing up a large block of memory.
.PP
You can tune this value by setting ora_oci_success_warn which will display the following
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  OCILobRead field 2 of 3 SUCCESS: csform 1 (SQLCS_IMPLICIT), LOBlen 10240(characters), LongReadLen
\&  20(characters), BufLen 80(characters), Got 28(characters)
.Ve
.PP
In the case above the query Got 28 characters (well really only 20 characters of 28 bytes) so we could use ora_ncs_buff_mtpl=>2 (20*2=40) thus saving 40bytes of memory.
.PP
\fISimple Fetch for CLOBs and BLOBs\fR
.IX Subsection "Simple Fetch for CLOBs and BLOBs"
.PP
To use this interface for CLOBs and LOBs datatypes set the 'ora_pers_lob' attribute of the statement handle to '1' with the prepare method, as well
set the database handle's 'LongReadLen' attribute to a value that will be the larger than the expected size of the \s-1LOB.\s0 If the size of the \s-1LOB\s0 exceeds
the 'LongReadLen' DBD::Oracle will return a '\s-1ORA\-24345: A\s0 Truncation' error.  To stop this set the database handle's 'LongTruncOk' attribute to '1'.
The maximum value of 'LongReadLen' seems to be dependent on the physical memory limits of the box that Oracle is running on in the same way that LONGs and \s-1LONG\s0 RAWs are.
.PP
For CLOBs and NCLOBs the limit is 64k chars if there is no truncation, this is an internal \s-1OCI\s0 limit complain to them if you want it changed.  However if you \s-1CLOB\s0 is longer than this
and also larger than the 'LongReadLen' than the 'LongReadLen' in chars is returned.
.PP
It seems with BLOBs you are not limited by the 64k.
.PP
For example give this table;
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  CREATE TABLE test_lob (id NUMBER,
\&               clob1 CLOB,
\&               clob2 CLOB,

.PP
before the execute will return all the lobs but they will be truncated at 2MBs.
.PP
\fIPiecewise Fetch with Callback\fR
.IX Subsection "Piecewise Fetch with Callback"
.PP
With a piecewise callback fetch DBD::Oracle sets up a function that will 'callback' to the \s-1DB\s0 during the fetch and gets your \s-1LOB \s0(\s-1LONG, LONG RAW, CLOB, BLOB\s0) piece by piece.
To use this interface set the 'ora_clbk_lob' attribute of the statement handle to '1' with the prepare method. Next set the 'ora_piece_size' to the size of the piece that
you want to return on the callback. Finally set the database handle's 'LongReadLen' attribute to a value that will be the larger than the expected
size of the \s-1LOB.\s0 Like the \*(L"Simple Fetch for LONGs and \s-1LONG\s0 RAWs\*(R" and \*(L"Simple Fetch for CLOBs and BLOBs\*(R" the if the size of the \s-1LOB\s0 exceeds the is 'LongReadLen' you can use the 'LongTruncOk' attribute to truncate the \s-1LOB\s0
or set the 'LongReadLen' to a higher value.  With this interface the value of 'ora_piece_size' seems to be constrained by the same memory limit as found on
the Simple Fetch interface. If you encounter an '\s-1ORA\-01062\s0' error try setting the value of 'ora_piece_size' to a smaller value.   The value for 'LongReadLen' is
dependent on the version and settings of the Oracle \s-1DB\s0 you are using. In theory it ranges from 8GBs
in 9iR1 up to 128 terabytes with 11g but you will also be limited by the physical memory of your \s-1PERL\s0 instance.
.PP
Using the table from the last example this code;
.PP
.Vb 11
\&  $dbh\->{LongReadLen} = 20*1024*1024; #20 meg

.PP
Will select out all of the LOBs in the table as long as they are all under 20MB in length. If the \s-1LOB\s0 is longer than 5MB (ora_piece_size) DBD::Oracle will fetch it in at least 2 pieces to a
maximum of 4 pieces (4*5MB=20MB). Like the Simple Fetch examples Lobs longer than 20MB will throw an error.

.SS "Locator Data Interface"
.IX Subsection "Locator Data Interface"
\fISimple Usage\fR
.IX Subsection "Simple Usage"
.PP
When fetching LOBs with this interface a '\s-1LOB\s0 Locator' is created then used to get the lob with the LongReadLen and LongTruncOk attributes.
The value for 'LongReadLen' is dependent on the version and settings of the Oracle \s-1DB\s0 you are using. In theory it ranges from 8GBs
in 9iR1 up to 128 terabytes with 11g but you will also be limited by the physical memory of your \s-1PERL\s0 instance.
.PP
When inserting or updating LOBs some \fImajor\fR magic has to be performed
behind the scenes to make it transparent.  Basically the driver has to
insert a '\s-1LOB\s0 Locator' and then refetch the newly inserted \s-1LOB\s0
Locator before being able to write the data into it.  However, it works
well most of the time, and I've made it as fast as possible, just one
extra server-round-trip per insert or update after the first.  For the
time being, only single-row \s-1LOB\s0 updates are supported.
.PP
To insert or update a large \s-1LOB\s0 using a placeholder, DBD::Oracle has to
know in advance that it is a \s-1LOB\s0 type. So you need to say:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $sth\->bind_param($field_num, $lob_value, { ora_type => ORA_CLOB });
.Ve
.PP
The \s-1ORA_CLOB\s0 and \s-1ORA_BLOB\s0 constants can be imported using
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use DBD::Oracle qw(:ora_types);
.Ve
.PP
or use the corresponding integer values (112 and 113).
.PP
One further wrinkle: for inserts and updates of LOBs, DBD::Oracle has
to be able to tell which parameters relate to which table fields.
In all cases where it can possibly work it out for itself, it does,
however, if there are multiple \s-1LOB\s0 fields of the same type in the table
then you need to tell it which field each \s-1LOB\s0 param relates to:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $sth\->bind_param($idx, $value, { ora_type=>ORA_CLOB, ora_field=>\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq });
.Ve
.PP
There are some limitations inherent in the way DBD::Oracle makes typical
\&\s-1LOB\s0 operations simple by hiding the \s-1LOB\s0 Locator processing:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& \- Can\*(Aqt read/write LOBs in chunks (except via DBMS_LOB.WRITEAPPEND in PL/SQL)
\& \- To INSERT a LOB, you need UPDATE privilege.
.Ve
.PP
The alternative is to disable the automatic \s-1LOB\s0 Locator processing.
If \*(L"ora_auto_lob\*(R" is 0 in \fIprepare()\fR, you can fetch the \s-1LOB\s0 Locators and
do all the work yourself using the ora_lob_*() methods.
See the \*(L"Data Interface for \s-1LOB\s0 Locators\*(R" section below.
.PP

.SS "Persistent & Locator Interface Caveats"
.IX Subsection "Persistent & Locator Interface Caveats"
Now that one has the option of using the Persistent or the Locator interface for LOBs the questions arises
which one to use. For starters, if you want to access LOBs over a dblink you will have to use the Persistent
interface so that choice is simple.  The question of which one to use after that is a little more tricky.
It basically boils down to a choice between \s-1LOB\s0 size and speed.
.PP
The Callback and Polling piecewise fetches are very very slow
when compared to the Simple and the Locator fetches but they can handle very large blocks of data. Given a situation where a
large \s-1LOB\s0 is to be read the Locator fetch may time out while either of the piecewise fetches may not.
.PP
With the Simple fetch you are limited by physical memory of your server but it runs a little faster than the Locator, as there are fewer round trips
to the server. So if you have small LOBs and need to save a little bandwidth this is the one to use. It you are going after large LOBs then the Locator interface is the one to use.
.PP
If you need to update more than a single row of with \s-1LOB\s0 data then the Persistent interface can do it while the Locator can't.
.PP
If you encounter a situation where you have to access the legacy LOBs (\s-1LONG, LONG RAW\s0) and the values are to large for you system then you can use
the Callback or Polling piecewise fetches to  get all of the data.
.PP
Not all of the Persistent interface has been implemented yet, the following are not supported;
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  1) Piecewise, polling and callback binds for INSERT and UPDATE operations.
\&  2) Piecewise array binds for SELECT, INSERT and UPDATE operations.
.Ve
.PP
Most of the time you should just use the \*(L"Locator Data Interface\*(R" as this is in one that has the best combination of speed and size.
.PP
All this being said if you are doing some critical programming I would use the \*(L"Data Interface for \s-1LOB\s0 Locators\*(R" as this gives you very
fine grain control of your LOBs, of course the code for this will be somewhat more involved.
.SS "Data Interface for \s-1LOB\s0 Locators"
.IX Subsection "Data Interface for LOB Locators"
The following driver-specific methods let you manipulate \*(L"\s-1LOB\s0 Locators\*(R" directly.
To select a \s-1LOB\s0 locator directly set the if the \f(CW\*(C`ora_auto_lob\*(C'\fR
attribute to false, or alternatively they can be returned via \s-1PL/SQL\s0 procedure calls.
.PP
(If using a \s-1DBI\s0 version earlier than 1.36 they must be called via the
\&\fIfunc()\fR method. Note that methods called via \fIfunc()\fR don't honour
RaiseError etc, and so it's important to check \f(CW$dbh\fR\->err after each call.
It's recommended that you upgrade to \s-1DBI 1.38\s0 or later.)
.PP
Note that \s-1LOB\s0 locators are only valid while the statement handle that
created them is valid.  When all references to the original statement
handle are lost, the handle is destroyed and the locators are freed.

\fIExample: Inserting a new row with large data\fR
.IX Subsection "Example: Inserting a new row with large data"
.PP
Unless enough memory is available to store and bind the
entire \s-1LOB\s0 data for insert all at once, the \s-1LOB\s0 columns must
be written interactively, piece by piece.  In the case of a new row,
this is performed by first inserting a row, with empty values in
the \s-1LOB\s0 columns, then modifying the row by writing the large data
interactively to the \s-1LOB\s0 columns using their \s-1LOB\s0 locators as handles.
.PP
The insert statement must create token values in the \s-1LOB\s0
columns.  Here, we use the empty string for both the binary
and character large object columns 'bindata' and 'chardata'.
.PP
After the \s-1INSERT\s0 statement, a \s-1SELECT\s0 statement is used to
acquire \s-1LOB\s0 locators to the 'bindata' and 'chardata' fields
of the newly inserted row.  Because these \s-1LOB\s0 locators are
subsequently written, they must be acquired from a select
statement containing the clause '\s-1FOR UPDATE\s0' (\s-1LOB\s0 locators
are only valid within the transaction that fetched them, so
can't be used effectively if AutoCommit is enabled).

In this example, we truncate the data already present in a
large object column in the database.  Specifically, for each
row in the table, we truncate the 'bindata' value to half
its previous length.
.PP
After acquiring a \s-1LOB\s0 Locator for the column, we query its
length, then we trim the length by half.  Because we modify
the large objects with the call to \fIora_lob_trim()\fR, we must
select the \s-1LOB\s0 locators '\s-1FOR UPDATE\s0'.

.SS "Trailing Spaces"
.IX Subsection "Trailing Spaces"
Only the Oracle \s-1OCI 8\s0 strips trailing spaces from \s-1VARCHAR\s0 placeholder
values and uses Nonpadded Comparison Semantics with the result.
This causes trouble if the spaces are needed for
comparison with a \s-1CHAR\s0 value or to prevent the value from
becoming '' which Oracle treats as \s-1NULL.\s0
Look for Blank-padded Comparison Semantics and Nonpadded
Comparison Semantics in Oracle's \s-1SQL\s0 Reference or Server
\&\s-1SQL\s0 Reference for more details.
.PP
To preserve trailing spaces in placeholder values for Oracle clients that use \s-1OCI 8,\s0
either change the default placeholder type with \*(L"ora_ph_type\*(R" or the placeholder
type for a particular call to \*(L"bind\*(R" in \s-1DBI\s0 or \*(L"bind_param_inout\*(R" in \s-1DBI\s0
with \*(L"ora_type\*(R" or \f(CW\*(C`TYPE\*(C'\fR.
Using \s-1ORA_CHAR\s0 with ora_type or \f(CW\*(C`SQL_CHAR\*(C'\fR with \f(CW\*(C`TYPE\*(C'\fR
allows the placeholder to be used with Padded Comparison Semantics
if the value it is being compared to is a \s-1CHAR, NCHAR,\s0 or literal.
.PP
Please remember that using spaces as a value or at the end of
a value makes visually distinguishing values with different
numbers of spaces difficult and should be avoided.
.PP
Oracle Clients that use \s-1OCI 9.2\s0 do not strip trailing spaces.
.SS "Padded Char Fields"
.IX Subsection "Padded Char Fields"
Oracle Clients after \s-1OCI 9.2\s0 will automatically pad \s-1CHAR\s0 placeholder values to the size of the \s-1CHAR.\s0
As the default placeholder type value in DBD::Oracle is \s-1ORA_VARCHAR2\s0 to access this behaviour you will
have to change the default placeholder type with \*(L"ora_ph_type\*(R" or placeholder
type for a particular call with \*(L"bind\*(R" in \s-1DBI\s0 or \*(L"bind_param_inout\*(R" in \s-1DBI\s0

Information about Unicode in general can be found at:

.SS "Perl and Unicode"
.IX Subsection "Perl and Unicode"
Perl began implementing Unicode with version 5.6, but the implementation
did not mature until version 5.8 and later. If you plan to use Unicode
you are \fIstrongly\fR urged to use Perl 5.8.2 or later and to \fIcarefully\fR read
the Perl documentation on Unicode:

.Ve
.PP
And then read it again.
.PP
Perl's internal Unicode format is \s-1UTF\-8\s0
which corresponds to the Oracle character set called \s-1AL32UTF8.\s0
.SS "Oracle and Unicode"
.IX Subsection "Oracle and Unicode"
Oracle supports many characters sets, including several different forms
of Unicode.  These include:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  AL16UTF16  =>  valid for NCHAR columns (CSID=2000)
\&  UTF8       =>  valid for NCHAR columns (CSID=871), deprecated
\&  AL32UTF8   =>  valid for NCHAR and CHAR columns (CSID=873)
.Ve
.PP
When you create an Oracle database, you must specify the \s-1DATABASE\s0
character set (used for \s-1DDL, DML\s0 and \s-1CHAR\s0 datatypes) and the \s-1NATIONAL\s0
character set (used for \s-1NCHAR\s0 and \s-1NCLOB\s0 types).
The character sets used in your database can be found using:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  $hash_ref = $dbh\->ora_nls_parameters()
\&  $database_charset = $hash_ref\->{NLS_CHARACTERSET};
\&  $national_charset = $hash_ref\->{NLS_NCHAR_CHARACTERSET};
.Ve
.PP
The Oracle 9.2 and later default for the national character set is \s-1AL16UTF16.\s0
The default for the database character set is often \s-1US7ASCII.\s0
Although many experienced DBAs will consider an 8bit character set like
\&\s-1WE8ISO8859P1\s0 or \s-1WE8MSWIN1252. \s0 To use any character set with Oracle
other than \s-1US7ASCII,\s0 requires that the \s-1NLS_LANG\s0 environment variable be set.
See the \*(L"Oracle \s-1UTF8\s0 is not \s-1UTF\-8\*(R"\s0 section below.
.PP
You are strongly urged to read the Oracle Internationalization documentation
specifically with respect the choices and trade offs for creating
a databases for use with international character sets.
.PP
Oracle uses the \s-1NLS_LANG\s0 environment variable to indicate what
character set is being used on the client.  When fetching data Oracle
will convert from whatever the database character set is to the client
character set specified by \s-1NLS_LANG.\s0 Similarly, when sending data to
the database Oracle will convert from the character set specified by
\&\s-1NLS_LANG\s0 to the database character set.
.PP
The \s-1NLS_NCHAR\s0 environment variable can be used to define a different
character set for 'national' (\s-1NCHAR\s0) character types.
.PP
Both \s-1UTF8\s0 and \s-1AL32UTF8\s0 can be used in \s-1NLS_LANG\s0 and \s-1NLS_NCHAR.\s0
For example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&   NLS_LANG=AMERICAN_AMERICA.UTF8
\&   NLS_LANG=AMERICAN_AMERICA.AL32UTF8
\&   NLS_NCHAR=UTF8
\&   NLS_NCHAR=AL32UTF8
.Ve
.SS "Oracle \s-1UTF8\s0 is not \s-1UTF\-8\s0"
.IX Subsection "Oracle UTF8 is not UTF-8"
\&\s-1AL32UTF8\s0 should be used in preference to \s-1UTF8\s0 if it works for you,
which it should for Oracle 9.2 or later. If you're using an old
version of Oracle that doesn't support \s-1AL32UTF8\s0 then you should
avoid using any Unicode characters that require surrogates, in other
words characters beyond the Unicode \s-1BMP \s0(Basic Multilingual Plane).
.PP
That's because the character set that Oracle calls \*(L"\s-1UTF8\*(R"\s0 doesn't
conform to the \s-1UTF\-8\s0 standard in its handling of surrogate characters.
Technically the encoding that Oracle calls \*(L"\s-1UTF8\*(R"\s0 is known as \*(L"\s-1CESU\-8\*(R".\s0
Here are a couple of extracts from <http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr26/>:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  CESU\-8 is useful in 8\-bit processing environments where binary
\&  collation with UTF\-16 is required. It is designed and recommended
\&  for use only within products requiring this UTF\-16 binary collation
\&  equivalence. It is not intended nor recommended for open interchange.
\&
\&  As a very small percentage of characters in a typical data stream
\&  are expected to be supplementary characters, there is a strong
\&  possibility that CESU\-8 data may be misinterpreted as UTF\-8.
\&  Therefore, all use of CESU\-8 outside closed implementations is
\&  strongly discouraged, such as the emittance of CESU\-8 in output
\&  files, markup language or other open transmission forms.
.Ve
.PP
Oracle uses this internally because it collates (sorts) in the same order
as \s-1UTF16,\s0 which is the basis of Oracle's internal collation definitions.
.PP
Rather than change \s-1UTF8\s0 for clients Oracle chose to define a new character
set called \*(L"\s-1AL32UTF8\*(R"\s0 which does conform to the \s-1UTF\-8\s0 standard.
(The \s-1AL32UTF8\s0 character set can't be used on the server because it
would break collation.)
.PP
Because of that, for the rest of this document we'll use \*(L"\s-1AL32UTF8\*(R".\s0
If you're using an Oracle version below 9.2 you'll need to use \*(L"\s-1UTF8\*(R"\s0
until you upgrade.
.SS "DBD::Oracle and Unicode"

\&\fBFetching Data\fR
.PP
Any data returned from Oracle to DBD::Oracle in the \s-1AL32UTF8\s0

\&\s-1NLS_LANG\s0 or \s-1NLS_NCHAR\s0 environment variable \fImust\fR be set as described
in the previous section.
.PP
When fetching \s-1NCHAR, NVARCHAR,\s0 or \s-1NCLOB\s0 data from Oracle, DBD::Oracle
will set the Perl \s-1UTF\-8\s0 flag on the returned data if either \s-1NLS_NCHAR\s0
is \s-1AL32UTF8,\s0 or \s-1NLS_NCHAR\s0 is not set and \s-1NLS_LANG\s0 is \s-1AL32UTF8.\s0

.PP
\&\fBSending Data using Placeholders\fR
.PP
Data bound to a placeholder is assumed to be in the default client
character set (specified by \s-1NLS_LANG\s0) except for a few special
cases. These are listed here with the highest precedence first:
.PP
If the \f(CW\*(C`ora_csid\*(C'\fR attribute is given to \fIbind_param()\fR then that
is passed to Oracle and takes precedence.
.PP
If the value is a Perl Unicode string (\s-1UTF\-8\s0) then DBD::Oracle
ensures that Oracle uses the Unicode character set, regardless of
the \s-1NLS_LANG\s0 and \s-1NLS_NCHAR\s0 settings.
.PP
If the placeholder is for inserting an \s-1NCLOB\s0 then the client \s-1NLS_NCHAR\s0
character set is used. (That's useful but inconsistent with the other behaviour
so may change. Best to be explicit by using the \f(CW\*(C`ora_csform\*(C'\fR
attribute.)
.PP
If the \f(CW\*(C`ora_csform\*(C'\fR attribute is given to \fIbind_param()\fR then that
determines if the value should be assumed to be in the default
(\s-1NLS_LANG\s0) or \s-1NCHAR \s0(\s-1NLS_NCHAR\s0) client character set.
.PP
.Vb 3

.SS "DBD::Oracle and Other Character Sets and Encodings"
.IX Subsection "DBD::Oracle and Other Character Sets and Encodings"
The only multi-byte Oracle character set supported by DBD::Oracle is

.SH "OBJECT & COLLECTION DATA TYPES"
.IX Header "OBJECT & COLLECTION DATA TYPES"
Oracle databases allow for the creation of object oriented like user-defined types.
There are two types of objects, Embedded\*(--an object stored in a column of a regular table
and REF\*(--an object that uses the \s-1REF\s0 retrieval mechanism.
.PP
DBD::Oracle supports only the 'selection' of embedded objects of the following types \s-1OBJECT, VARRAY\s0
and \s-1TABLE\s0 in any combination. Support is seamless and recursive, meaning you
need only supply a simple \s-1SQL\s0 statement to get all the values in an embedded object.
You can either get the values as an array of scalars or they can be returned into a DBD::Oracle::Object.
.PP
Array example, given this type and table;
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE  "PHONE_NUMBERS" as varray(10) of varchar(30);
\&
\&  CREATE TABLE  "CONTACT"
\&     (  "COMPANYNAME" VARCHAR2(40),
\&        "ADDRESS" VARCHAR2(100),
\&        "PHONE_NUMBERS"  "PHONE_NUMBERS"
\&   )
.Ve
.PP
The code to access all the data in the table could be something like this;
.PP
.Vb 6
\&   my $sth = $dbh\->prepare(\*(AqSELECT * FROM CONTACT\*(Aq);
\&   $sth\->execute;
\&   while ( my ($company, $address, $phone) = $sth\->fetchrow()) {
\&        print "Company: ".$company."\en";
\&        print "Address: ".$address."\en";
\&        print "Phone #: ";
\&
\&        foreach my $items (@$phone){
\&           print $items.", ";
\&        }
\&        print "\en";
\&   }
.Ve
.PP
Note that values in \s-1PHONE_NUMBERS\s0 are returned as an array reference '@$phone'.
.PP
As stated before DBD::Oracle will automatically drill into the embedded object and extract
all of the data as reference arrays of scalars. The example below has \s-1OBJECT\s0 type embedded in a \s-1TABLE\s0 type embedded in an
\&\s-1SQL TABLE\s0;
.PP

.SH "OTHER DATA TYPES"
.IX Header "OTHER DATA TYPES"
DBD::Oracle does not \fIexplicitly\fR support most Oracle datatypes.
It simply asks Oracle to return them as strings and Oracle does so.
Mostly.  Similarly when binding placeholder values DBD::Oracle binds
them as strings and Oracle converts them to the appropriate type,
such as \s-1DATE,\s0 when used.
.PP
Some of these automatic conversions to and from strings use \s-1NLS\s0
settings to control the formatting for output and the parsing for
input. The most common example is the \s-1DATE\s0 type. The default \s-1NLS\s0
format for \s-1DATE\s0 might be DD-MON-YYYY and so when a \s-1DATE\s0 type is
fetched that's how Oracle will format the date. \s-1NLS\s0 settings also
control the default parsing of strings into \s-1DATE\s0 values. An error
will be generated if the contents of the string don't match the
\&\s-1NLS\s0 format. If you're dealing in dates which don't match the default
\&\s-1NLS\s0 format then you can either change the default \s-1NLS\s0 format or, more
commonly, use \s-1TO_CHAR\s0(field, \*(L"format\*(R") and \s-1TO_DATE\s0(?, \*(L"format\*(R")
to explicitly specify formats for converting to and from strings.
.PP
A slightly more subtle problem can occur with \s-1NUMBER\s0 types. The
default \s-1NLS\s0 settings might format numbers with a fullstop ("\f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR\*(L")
to separate thousands and a comma (\*(R"\f(CW\*(C`,\*(C'\fR") as the decimal point.
Perl will generate warnings and use incorrect values when numbers,
returned and formatted as strings in this way by Oracle, are used
in a numeric context.  You could explicitly convert each numeric
value using the \s-1TO_CHAR\s0(...) function but that gets tedious very
quickly. The best fix is to change the \s-1NLS\s0 settings. That can be
done for an individual connection by doing:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh\->do("ALTER SESSION SET NLS_NUMERIC_CHARACTERS = \*(Aq.,\*(Aq");
.Ve
.PP
There are some types, like \s-1BOOLEAN,\s0 that Oracle does not automatically
convert to or from strings (pity).  These need to be converted
explicitly using \s-1SQL\s0 or \s-1PL/SQL\s0 functions.

Inserting large \s-1XML\s0 data sets into tables with XMLType fields is now supported by DBD::Oracle. The only special

Cursors can be returned from \s-1PL/SQL\s0 blocks, either from stored
functions (or procedures with \s-1OUT\s0 parameters) or
from direct \f(CW\*(C`OPEN\*(C'\fR statements, as shown below:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  use DBI;
\&  use DBD::Oracle qw(:ora_types);
\&  my $dbh = DBI\->connect(...);
\&  my $sth1 = $dbh\->prepare(q{
\&      BEGIN OPEN :cursor FOR
\&          SELECT table_name, tablespace_name
\&          FROM user_tables WHERE tablespace_name = :space;
\&      END;
\&  });
\&  $sth1\->bind_param(":space", "USERS");
\&  my $sth2;
\&  $sth1\->bind_param_inout(":cursor", \e$sth2, 0, { ora_type => ORA_RSET } );
\&  $sth1\->execute;
\&  # $sth2 is now a valid DBI statement handle for the cursor
\&  while ( my @row = $sth2\->fetchrow_array ) { ... }
.Ve
.PP
The only special requirement is the use of \f(CW\*(C`bind_param_inout()\*(C'\fR with an
attribute hash parameter that specifies \f(CW\*(C`ora_type\*(C'\fR as \f(CW\*(C`ORA_RSET\*(C'\fR.
If you don't do that you'll get an error from the \f(CW\*(C`execute()\*(C'\fR like:
\&\*(L"\s-1ORA\-06550:\s0 line X, column Y: \s-1PLS\-00306:\s0 wrong number or types of
arguments in call to ...\*(R".
.PP
Here's an alternative form using a function that returns a cursor.
This example uses the pre-defined weak (or generic) \s-1REF CURSOR\s0 type
\&\s-1SYS_REFCURSOR.\s0 This is an Oracle 9 feature.
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  # Create the function that returns a cursor
\&  $dbh\->do(q{
\&      CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION sp_ListEmp RETURN SYS_REFCURSOR
\&      AS l_cursor SYS_REFCURSOR;
\&      BEGIN
\&          OPEN l_cursor FOR select ename, empno from emp
\&              ORDER BY ename;
\&          RETURN l_cursor;
\&      END;
\&  });
\&
\&  # Use the function that returns a cursor
\&  my $sth1 = $dbh\->prepare(q{BEGIN :cursor := sp_ListEmp; END;});
\&  my $sth2;
\&  $sth1\->bind_param_inout(":cursor", \e$sth2, 0, { ora_type => ORA_RSET } );
\&  $sth1\->execute;
\&  # $sth2 is now a valid DBI statement handle for the cursor
\&  while ( my @row = $sth2\->fetchrow_array ) { ... }
.Ve
.PP
A cursor obtained from \s-1PL/SQL\s0 as above may be passed back to \s-1PL/SQL\s0
by binding for input, as shown in this example, which explicitly
closes a cursor:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  my $sth3 = $dbh\->prepare("BEGIN CLOSE :cursor; END;");
\&  $sth3\->bind_param(":cursor", $sth2, { ora_type => ORA_RSET } );
\&  $sth3\->execute;
.Ve
.PP
It is not normally necessary to close a cursor explicitly in this
way. Oracle will close the cursor automatically at the first
client-server interaction after the cursor statement handle is
destroyed. An explicit close may be desirable if the reference to the
cursor handle from the \s-1PL/SQL\s0 statement handle delays the destruction
of the cursor handle for too long. This reference remains until the
\&\s-1PL/SQL\s0 handle is re-bound, re-executed or destroyed.
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 From DBD::Oracle 1.57 functions or procedures returning
SYS_REFCURSORs which have not been opened (are still in the
initialised state) will return undef for the cursor statement handle
e.g., in the example above if the sp_ListEmp function simply returned l_cursor
instead of opening it. This means you can have a function/procedure
which can elect to open the cursor or not, Before this change if you called
a function/procedure which returned a \s-1SYS_REFCURSOR\s0 which was not opened
DBD::Oracle would error in the execute for a OCIAttrGet on the uninitialised
cursor.
.PP
See the \f(CW\*(C`curref.pl\*(C'\fR script in the Oracle.ex directory in the DBD::Oracle
source distribution for a complete working example.
.SS "Fetching Nested Cursors"
.IX Subsection "Fetching Nested Cursors"
Oracle supports the use of select list expressions of type \s-1REF CURSOR.\s0
These may be explicit cursor expressions \- \f(CW\*(C`CURSOR(SELECT ...)\*(C'\fR, or
calls to \s-1PL/SQL\s0 functions which return \s-1REF CURSOR\s0 values. The values
of these expressions are known as nested cursors.
.PP
The value returned to a Perl program when a nested cursor is fetched
is a statement handle. This statement handle is ready to be fetched from.
It should not (indeed, must not) be executed.
.PP
Oracle imposes a restriction on the order of fetching when nested
cursors are used. Suppose \f(CW$sth1\fR is a handle for a select statement
involving nested cursors, and \f(CW$sth2\fR is a nested cursor handle fetched
from \f(CW$sth1\fR. \f(CW$sth2\fR can only be fetched from while \f(CW$sth1\fR is
still active, and the row containing \f(CW$sth2\fR is still current in \f(CW$sth1\fR.
Any attempt to fetch another row from \f(CW$sth1\fR renders all nested cursor
handles previously fetched from \f(CW$sth1\fR defunct.
.PP
Fetching from such a defunct handle results in an error with the message
\&\f(CW\*(C`ERROR nested cursor is defunct (parent row is no longer current)\*(C'\fR.
.PP
This means that the \f(CW\*(C`fetchall...\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`selectall...\*(C'\fR methods are not useful
for queries returning nested cursors. By the time such a method returns,
all the nested cursor handles it has fetched will be defunct.
.PP
It is necessary to use an explicit fetch loop, and to do all the
fetching of nested cursors within the loop, as the following example
shows:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    use DBI;
\&    my $dbh = DBI\->connect(...);
\&    my $sth = $dbh\->prepare(q{
\&        SELECT dname, CURSOR(
\&            SELECT ename FROM emp
\&                WHERE emp.deptno = dept.deptno
\&                ORDER BY ename
\&        ) FROM dept ORDER BY dname
\&    });
\&    $sth\->execute;
\&    while ( my ($dname, $nested) = $sth\->fetchrow_array ) {
\&        print "$dname\en";
\&        while ( my ($ename) = $nested\->fetchrow_array ) {
\&            print "        $ename\en";
\&        }
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
The cursor returned by the function \f(CW\*(C`sp_ListEmp\*(C'\fR defined in the
previous section can be fetched as a nested cursor as follows:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    my $sth = $dbh\->prepare(q{SELECT sp_ListEmp FROM dual});
\&    $sth\->execute;
\&    my ($nested) = $sth\->fetchrow_array;
\&    while ( my @row = $nested\->fetchrow_array ) { ... }
.Ve
.SS "Pre-fetching Nested Cursors"
.IX Subsection "Pre-fetching Nested Cursors"
By default, DBD::Oracle pre-fetches rows in order to reduce the number of
round trips to the server. For queries which do not involve nested cursors,
the number of pre-fetched rows is controlled by the \s-1DBI\s0 database handle
attribute \f(CW\*(C`RowCacheSize\*(C'\fR (q.v.).
.PP
In Oracle, server side open cursors are a controlled resource, limited in
number, on a per session basis, to the value of the initialization
parameter \f(CW\*(C`OPEN_CURSORS\*(C'\fR. Nested cursors count towards this limit.
Each nested cursor in the current row counts 1, as does
each nested cursor in a pre-fetched row. Defunct nested cursors do not count.
.PP
An Oracle specific database handle attribute, \f(CW\*(C`ora_max_nested_cursors\*(C'\fR,
further controls pre-fetching for queries involving nested cursors. For
each statement handle, the total number of nested cursors in pre-fetched
rows is limited to the value of this parameter. The default value
is 0, which disables pre-fetching for queries involving nested cursors.

As there are dozens of different versions of Oracle's clients this
list does not include all of them, just the major released versions of
Oracle.
.PP
Note that one can still connect to any Oracle version with the older
DBD::Oracle versions the only problem you will have is that some of
the newer \s-1OCI\s0 and Oracle features available in later DBD::Oracle
releases will not be available to you.
.PP
So to make a short story a little longer:
.IP "1." 4
If you are using Oracle 7 or early 8 \s-1DB\s0 and you can manage to get a 9 client and you can use
any DBD::Oracle version.
.IP "2." 4
If you have to use an Oracle 7 client then DBD::Oracle 1.17 should work
.IP "3." 4
Same thing for 8 up to R2, use 1.17, if you are lucky and have the right patch-set you might
go with 1.18.
.IP "4." 4
For 8iR3 you can use any of the DBD::Oracle versions up to 1.21. Again this depends on your
patch-set, If you run into trouble go with 1.19
.IP "5." 4
After 9.2 you can use any version you want.
.IP "6." 4
It seems that the 10g client can only connect to 9 and 11 DBs while the 9 can go back to 7
and even get to 10. I am not sure what the 11g client can connect to.

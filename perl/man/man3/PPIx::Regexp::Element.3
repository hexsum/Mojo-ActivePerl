.SH "NAME"
PPIx::Regexp::Element \- Base of the PPIx::Regexp hierarchy.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
No user-serviceable parts inside.
.SH "INHERITANCE"
.IX Header "INHERITANCE"
\&\f(CW\*(C`PPIx::Regexp::Element\*(C'\fR is not descended from any other class.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`PPIx::Regexp::Element\*(C'\fR is the parent of
PPIx::Regexp::Node and
PPIx::Regexp::Token.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This class is the base of the PPIx::Regexp
object hierarchy. It provides the same kind of navigational
functionality that is provided by PPI::Element.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
This class provides the following public methods. Methods not documented
here are private, and unsupported in the sense that the author reserves
the right to change or remove them without notice.
.SS "ancestor_of"
.IX Subsection "ancestor_of"
This method returns true if the object is an ancestor of the argument,
and false otherwise. By the definition of this method, \f(CW$self\fR is its
own ancestor.
.SS "can_be_quantified"
.IX Subsection "can_be_quantified"
.Vb 2
\& $token\->can_be_quantified()
\&     and print "This element can be quantified.\en";
.Ve
.PP
This method returns true if the element can be quantified.
.SS "class"
.IX Subsection "class"
This method returns the class name of the element. It is the same as
\&\f(CW\*(C`ref $self\*(C'\fR.
.SS "comment"
.IX Subsection "comment"
This method returns true if the element is a comment and false
otherwise.
.SS "content"
.IX Subsection "content"
This method returns the content of the element.
.SS "descendant_of"
.IX Subsection "descendant_of"
This method returns true if the object is a descendant of the argument,
and false otherwise. By the definition of this method, \f(CW$self\fR is its
own descendant.
.SS "error"
.IX Subsection "error"
.Vb 1
\& say $token\->error();
.Ve
.PP
If an element is one of the classes that represents a parse error, this
method \fBmay\fR return a brief message saying why. Otherwise it will
return \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.SS "is_quantifier"
.IX Subsection "is_quantifier"
.Vb 2
\& $token\->is_quantifier()
\&     and print "This element is a quantifier.\en";
.Ve
.PP
This method returns true if the element is a quantifier. You can not
tell this from the element's class, because a right curly bracket may
represent a quantifier for the purposes of figuring out whether a
greediness token is possible.
.SS "modifier_asserted"
.IX Subsection "modifier_asserted"
.Vb 2
\& $token\->modifier_asserted( \*(Aqi\*(Aq )
\&     and print "Matched without regard to case.\en";
.Ve
.PP
This method returns true if the given modifier is in effect for the
element, and false otherwise.
.PP
What it does is to walk backwards from the element until it finds a
modifier object that specifies the modifier, whether asserted or
negated. and returns the specified value. If nobody specifies the
modifier, it returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.PP
This method will not work reliably if called on tokenizer output.
.SS "next_sibling"
.IX Subsection "next_sibling"
This method returns the element's next sibling, or nothing if there is
none.
.SS "parent"
.IX Subsection "parent"
This method returns the parent of the element, or undef if there is
none.
.SS "perl_version_introduced"
.IX Subsection "perl_version_introduced"
This method returns the version of Perl in which the element was
introduced. This will be at least 5.000. Before 5.006 I am relying on
the \fIperldelta\fR, \fIperlre\fR, and \fIperlop\fR documentation, since I have
been unable to build earlier Perls. Since I have found no documentation
before 5.003, I assume that anything found in 5.003 is also in 5.000.
.PP
Since this all depends on my ability to read and understand masses of
documentation, the results of this method should be viewed with caution,
if not downright skepticism.
.PP
There are also cases which are ambiguous in various ways. For those see
\&\*(L"\s-1RESTRICTIONS\*(R"\s0 in PPIx::Regexp, and especially
\&\*(L"Changes in Syntax\*(R" in PPIx::Regexp.
.SS "perl_version_removed"
.IX Subsection "perl_version_removed"
This method returns the version of Perl in which the element was
removed. If the element is still valid the return is \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.PP
All the \fIcaveats\fR to
\&\fIperl_version_introduced()\fR apply here also,
though perhaps less severely since although many features have been
introduced since 5.0, few have been removed.
.SS "previous_sibling"
.IX Subsection "previous_sibling"
This method returns the element's previous sibling, or nothing if there
is none.
.SS "significant"
.IX Subsection "significant"
This method returns true if the element is significant and false
otherwise.
.SS "snext_sibling"
.IX Subsection "snext_sibling"
This method returns the element's next significant sibling, or nothing
if there is none.
.SS "sprevious_sibling"
.IX Subsection "sprevious_sibling"
This method returns the element's previous significant sibling, or
nothing if there is none.
.SS "tokens"
.IX Subsection "tokens"
This method returns all tokens contained in the element.
.SS "top"
.IX Subsection "top"
This method returns the top of the hierarchy.
.SS "unescaped_content"
.IX Subsection "unescaped_content"
This method returns the content of the element, unescaped.
.SS "whitespace"
.IX Subsection "whitespace"
This method returns true if the element is whitespace and false
otherwise.
.SS "nav"
.IX Subsection "nav"
This method returns navigation information from the top of the hierarchy
to this node. The return is a list of names of methods and references to
their argument lists. The idea is that given \f(CW$elem\fR which is somewhere
under \f(CW$top\fR,
.PP
.Vb 9
\& my @nav = $elem\->nav();
\& my $obj = $top;
\& while ( @nav ) {
\&     my $method = shift @nav;
\&     my $args = shift @nav;
\&     $obj = $obj\->$method( @{ $args } ) or die;
\& }
\& # At this point, $obj should contain the same object
\& # as $elem.

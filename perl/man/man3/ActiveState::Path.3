This module provides a collection of small utility functions dealing
with file paths.
.PP
The following functions are provided:
.ie n .IP "abs_path( $path )" 4
.el .IP "abs_path( \f(CW$path\fR )" 4
.IX Item "abs_path( $path )"
Returns an absolute pathname denoting the same file as \f(CW$path\fR.  If
\&\f(CW$path\fR is already absolute it is returned unchanged.  The \f(CW$path\fR does
not have to reference an existing file or directory.
.Sp
This functions differs from \fIrealpath()\fR by only removing \*(L".\*(R" or \*(L"..\*(R"
segments at the beginning of \f(CW$path\fR and by only resolving the
symlinks needed to process the \*(L"..\*(R" segments correctly.  The
\&\fIrealpath()\fR function also requires the file at \f(CW$path\fR to exist.
.ie n .IP "find_prog( $name )" 4
.el .IP "find_prog( \f(CW$name\fR )" 4
.IX Item "find_prog( $name )"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "find_prog( $path )" 4
.el .IP "find_prog( \f(CW$path\fR )" 4
.IX Item "find_prog( $path )"
.PD
This function returns the full path to the given program if it can be
located on the system.  Otherwise \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is returned.
.Sp
The returned path might be relative.
.ie n .IP "is_abs_path( $path )" 4
.el .IP "is_abs_path( \f(CW$path\fR )" 4
.IX Item "is_abs_path( $path )"
Returns \s-1TRUE\s0 if \f(CW$path\fR is an absolute file name.  This function works
the same as File::Spec method \fIfile_name_is_absolute()\fR.
.ie n .IP "join_path( $base, $path )" 4
.el .IP "join_path( \f(CW$base\fR, \f(CW$path\fR )" 4
.IX Item "join_path( $base, $path )"
Returns a path that will reference the same file as \f(CW$path\fR does when
the current directory is \f(CW$base\fR.  If \f(CW$path\fR is absolute then it is
returned unchanged.
.Sp
The \f(CW$base\fR should reference an existing directory.  The \f(CW$path\fR does not
have to refence an existing file or directory.
.Sp
Any leading \*(L".\*(R" and \*(L"..\*(R" segments are removed from the \f(CW$path\fR before
the paths are joined.  In order to process \*(L"..\*(R" segments \fIjoin_path()\fR
will need to resolve symlinks in \f(CW$base\fR, and the function might croak
if this involves a symlink cycle.
.IP "\fIpath_list()\fR" 4
.IX Item "path_list()"
Returns the list of directories that will be searched to find
programs.  The \fIpath_list()\fR is derived from the \s-1PATH\s0 environment
variable.  In scalar context this returns the number of paths to be
searched.
.Sp
On Unix when the \s-1PATH\s0 environment variable is not present then this
function returns an empty list, but most shells still default to a
path list like (\fI/usr/bin\fR, \fI/bin\fR).
.ie n .IP "realpath( $path )" 4
.el .IP "realpath( \f(CW$path\fR )" 4
.IX Item "realpath( $path )"
Returns the canonicalized absolute pathname of the path passed in.
All symbolic links are expanded and references to \fI/./\fR, \fI/../\fR and
extra \fI/\fR characters are resolved.  The \f(CW$path\fR passed in must be an
existing file.  The function will croak if not, or if the symbolic
links can't be expanded.
.Sp
This differs from the \fICwd::realpath()\fR function in that \f(CW$path\fR does
not have to be a directory.
.ie n .IP "rel_path( $base, $path )" 4
.el .IP "rel_path( \f(CW$base\fR, \f(CW$path\fR )" 4
.IX Item "rel_path( $base, $path )"
Return a relative pathname that denotes the same file as \f(CW$path\fR when
\&\f(CW$base\fR is the current directory.
.Sp
The \f(CW$base\fR should reference an existing directory.  The \f(CW$path\fR does not
have to refence an existing file or directory.
.Sp
This function differs from the File::Spec method \fIabs2rel()\fR in that it
make sure that any \*(L"..\*(R" segments in the returned value is correct when
the corresponding \f(CW$base\fR segments are symlinks.  If the \f(CW$base\fR path
contains symlink cycles there might not be any relative path that can
be produced, and in that case \fIrel_path()\fR falls back to returning
abs_path($path).
.ie n .IP "unsymlinked( $path )" 4
.el .IP "unsymlinked( \f(CW$path\fR )" 4
.IX Item "unsymlinked( $path )"
If \f(CW$path\fR denotes a symlink expand it, otherwise return \f(CW$path\fR
unchanged.  The \f(CW$path\fR must reference an existing file.  This function
differs from \fIrealpath()\fR by only expanding the symlink at the last
segment of \f(CW$path\fR.
.Sp
On systems that don't implement symlinks this function is a noop,
always returning \f(CW$path\fR unchanged.
.Sp
This function will croak if it's not possible to expand the symlink
because of cycles.

DBD::ODBC \- ODBC Driver for DBI
.SH "VERSION"
.IX Header "VERSION"
This documentation refers to \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 version 1.52.
.SH "WARNING"
.IX Header "WARNING"
This version of \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 contains a significant fix to unicode when
inserting into \s-1CHAR/VARCHAR\s0 columns and it is a change in behaviour
from 1.45. The change \fBonly\fR applies to unicode builds of \s-1DBD::ODBC
\&\s0(the default on Windows but you can build it for unicode on unix too)
and char/varchar columns and not nchar/nvarchar columns.
.PP
Prior to this release of \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 when you are using the unicode
build of \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 and inserted data into a \s-1CHAR/VARCHAR\s0 columns using
parameters \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 did this:
.PP
1 if you set odbc_describe_parameters to 0, (thus preventing \s-1DBD::ODBC
 \s0 from calling SQLDescribeParam) parameters for \s-1CHAR/VARCHAR\s0 columns
  were bound as \s-1SQL_WVARCHAR\s0 or \s-1SQL_WLONGVARCHAR \s0(depending on the
  length of the parameter).
.PP
2 if you set odbc_force_bind_type then all parameters are bound as you
  specified.
.PP
3 if you override the parameter type in the bind_param method, the
  type you specified would be used.
.PP
4 if the driver does not support SQLDescribeParam or SQLDescribeParam
  was called and failed then the bind type defaulted as in 1.
.PP
5 if none of the above (and I'd guess that is the normal case for most
  people) then \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 calls SQLDescribeParam to find the parameter
  type. This usually returns \s-1SQL_CHAR\s0 or \s-1SQL_VARCHAR\s0 for \s-1CHAR/VARCHAR
 \s0 columns unsurprisingly. The parameter was then bound as \s-1SQL_VARCHAR.\s0
.PP
Items 1 to 4 still apply. 5 now has a different behaviour. In this
release, \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 now looks at your bound data first before using the
type returned by SQLDescribeParam. If you data looks like unicode
(i.e., \fISvUTF8()\fR is true) it now binds the parameter as \s-1SQL_WVARCHAR.\s0
.PP
What might this might mean to you?
.PP
If you had Perl scalars that were bound to \s-1CHAR/VARCHAR\s0 columns in an
insert/update/delete and those scalars contained unicode, \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0
would actually pass the individual octets in your scalar not
characters.  For instance, if you had the Perl scalar \*(L"\ex{20ac}\*(R" (the
Euro unicode character) and you bound it to a \s-1CHAR/VARCHAR, DBD::ODBC\s0
would pass 0xe2, 0x82, 0xc2 as separate characters because those bytes
were Perl's \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoding of a euro. These would probably be
interpreted by your database engine as 3 characters in its current
codepage. If you queried your database to find the length of the data
inserted you'd probably get back 3, not 1.
.PP
However, when \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 read that column back in a select
statement, it would bind the column as \s-1SQL_WCHAR\s0 and you'd get back 3
characters with the utf8 flag on (what those characters were depends
on how your database or driver translates code page characters to wide
characters).
.PP
What should happen now is that if your bound parameters are unicode,
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 will bind them as wide characters (unicode) and your driver
or database will attempt to convert them into the code page it is
using. This means so long as your database can store the data you are
inserting, when you read it back you should get what you inserted.

.SS "Important note about the tests"
.IX Subsection "Important note about the tests"
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 is unlike most other DBDs in that it connects to literally
dozens of possible \s-1ODBC\s0 Drivers. It is practically impossible for me
to test every one and so some tests may fail with some \s-1ODBC\s0 Drivers.
This does not mean \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 will not work with your \s-1ODBC\s0 Driver but
it is worth reporting any test failures on rt.cpan.org or to the
dbi-users mailing list.
.SS "\s-1DBI\s0 attribute handling"
.IX Subsection "DBI attribute handling"
If a \s-1DBI\s0 defined attribute is not mentioned here it behaves as per the
\&\s-1DBI\s0 specification.
.PP
\fIReadOnly (boolean)\fR
.IX Subsection "ReadOnly (boolean)"
.PP
\&\s-1DBI\s0 documents the \f(CW\*(C`ReadOnly\*(C'\fR attribute as being settable and
retrievable on connection and statement handles. In \s-1ODBC\s0 setting
ReadOnly to true causes the connection attribute \f(CW\*(C`SQL_ATTR_ACCESS_MODE\*(C'\fR
to be set to \f(CW\*(C`SQL_MODE_READ_ONLY\*(C'\fR and setting it to false will set the
access mode to \f(CW\*(C`SQL_MODE_READ_WRITE\*(C'\fR (which is the default in \s-1ODBC\s0).
.PP
\&\fBNote:\fR There is no equivalent of setting ReadOnly on a statement
handle in \s-1ODBC.\s0
.PP
\&\fBNote:\fR See \s-1ODBC\s0 documentation on \f(CW\*(C`SQL_ATTR_ACCESS_MODE\*(C'\fR as setting it
to \f(CW\*(C`SQL_MODE_READ_ONLY\*(C'\fR does \fBnot\fR prevent your script from running
updates or deletes; it is simply a hint to the driver/database that
you won't being doing updates.
.PP
\&\fBNote:\fR Since \s-1DBD::ODCB 1.44_3,\s0 if the driver does not support
setting \f(CW\*(C`SQL_ATTR_ACCESS_MODE\*(C'\fR and returns \s-1SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO\s0 and
\&\*(L"option value changed\*(R" a warning is issued (which you'll only see if
you have \s-1DBI \s0> 1.628).  In addition, any subsequent attempts to fetch
the ReadOnly attribute will return the value last set.
.PP
This attribute requires \s-1DBI\s0 version 1.55 or better.
.SS "Private attributes common to connection and statement handles"
.IX Subsection "Private attributes common to connection and statement handles"
\fIodbc_ignore_named_placeholders\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_ignore_named_placeholders"
.PP
Use this if you have special needs (such as Oracle triggers, etc)
where :new or :name mean something special and are not just place
holder names. You \fBmust\fR then use ? for binding parameters.  Example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& $dbh\->{odbc_ignore_named_placeholders} = 1;
\& $dbh\->do("create trigger foo as if :new.x <> :old.x then ... etc");
.Ve
.PP
Without this, \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 will think :new and :old are placeholders for
binding and get confused.
.PP
\fIodbc_default_bind_type\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_default_bind_type"
.PP
This value defaults to 0.
.PP
Older versions of \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 assumed that the parameter binding type
was 12 (\f(CW\*(C`SQL_VARCHAR\*(C'\fR).  Newer versions always attempt to call
\&\f(CW\*(C`SQLDescribeParam\*(C'\fR to find the parameter types but if
\&\f(CW\*(C`SQLDescribeParam\*(C'\fR is unavailable \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 falls back to a default
bind type. The internal default bind type is \f(CW\*(C`SQL_VARCHAR\*(C'\fR (for
non-unicode build) and \f(CW\*(C`SQL_WVARCHAR\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`SQL_VARCHAR\*(C'\fR (for a
unicode build depending on whether the parameter is unicode or
not). If you set \f(CW\*(C`odbc_default_bind_type\*(C'\fR to a value other than 0 you
override the internal default.
.PP
\&\fBN.B\fR If you call the \f(CW\*(C`bind_param\*(C'\fR method with a \s-1SQL\s0 type this
overrides everything else above.
.PP
\fIodbc_force_bind_type\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_force_bind_type"
.PP
This value defaults to 0.
.PP
If set to anything other than 0 this will force bound parameters to be
bound as this type and \f(CW\*(C`SQLDescribeParam\*(C'\fR will not be used; in other
words it implies \*(L"odbc_describe_parameters\*(R" is set to false too.
.PP
Older versions of \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 assumed the parameter binding type was 12
(\f(CW\*(C`SQL_VARCHAR\*(C'\fR) and newer versions always attempt to call
\&\f(CW\*(C`SQLDescribeParam\*(C'\fR to find the parameter types. If your driver
supports \f(CW\*(C`SQLDescribeParam\*(C'\fR and it succeeds it may still fail to
describe the parameters accurately (\s-1MS SQL\s0 Server sometimes does this
with some \s-1SQL\s0 like \fIselect myfunc(?)  where 1 = 1\fR). Setting
\&\f(CW\*(C`odbc_force_bind_type\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`SQL_VARCHAR\*(C'\fR will force \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 to bind
all the parameters as \f(CW\*(C`SQL_VARCHAR\*(C'\fR and ignore SQLDescribeParam.
.PP
Bear in mind that if you are inserting unicode data you probably want
to use \f(CW\*(C`SQL_WVARCHAR\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`SQL_WCHAR\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`SQL_WLONGVARCHAR\*(C'\fR and not
\&\f(CW\*(C`SQL_VARCHAR\*(C'\fR.
.PP
As this attribute was created to work around buggy \s-1ODBC\s0 Drivers which
support SQLDescribeParam but describe the parameters incorrectly you
are probably better specifying the bind type on the \f(CW\*(C`bind_param\*(C'\fR call
on a per statement level rather than blindly setting
\&\f(CW\*(C`odbc_force_bind_type\*(C'\fR across a whole connection.
.PP
\&\fBN.B\fR If you call the \f(CW\*(C`bind_param\*(C'\fR method with a \s-1SQL\s0 type this
overrides everything else above.
.PP
\fIodbc_force_rebind\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_force_rebind"
.PP
This is to handle special cases, especially when using multiple result sets.
Set this before execute to \*(L"force\*(R" \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 to re-obtain the result set's
number of columns and column types for each execute.  Especially useful for
calling stored procedures which may return different result sets each
execute.  The only performance penalty is during \fIexecute()\fR, but I didn't
want to incur that penalty for all circumstances.  It is probably fairly
rare that this occurs.  This attribute will be automatically set when
multiple result sets are triggered.  Most people shouldn't have to worry
about this.
.PP
\fIodbc_async_exec\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_async_exec"
.PP
Allow asynchronous execution of queries.  This causes a spin-loop
(with a small \*(L"sleep\*(R") until the \s-1ODBC API\s0 being called is complete
(i.e., while the \s-1ODBC API\s0 returns \f(CW\*(C`SQL_STILL_EXECUTING\*(C'\fR).  This is
useful, however, if you want the error handling and asynchronous
messages (see the \*(L"odbc_err_handler\*(R" and \fIt/20SQLServer.t\fR for an
example of this).
.PP
\fIodbc_query_timeout\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_query_timeout"
.PP
This allows you to change the \s-1ODBC\s0 query timeout (the \s-1ODBC\s0 statement
attribute \f(CW\*(C`SQL_ATTR_QUERY_TIMEOUT\*(C'\fR). \s-1ODBC\s0 defines the query time out as
the number of seconds to wait for a \s-1SQL\s0 statement to execute before
returning to the application. A value of 0 (the default) means there
is no time out. Do not confuse this with the \s-1ODBC\s0 attributes
\&\f(CW\*(C`SQL_ATTR_LOGIN_TIMEOUT\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`SQL_ATTR_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT\*(C'\fR. Add
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  { odbc_query_timeout => 30 }
.Ve
.PP
to your connect, set on the \f(CW\*(C`dbh\*(C'\fR before creating a statement or
explicitly set it on your statement handle. The odbc_query_timeout on
a statement is inherited from the parent connection.
.PP
Note that internally \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 only sets the query timeout if you set it
explicitly and the default of 0 (no time out) is implemented by the
\&\s-1ODBC\s0 driver and not \s-1DBD::ODBC.\s0
.PP
Note that some \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers implement a maximum query timeout value
and will limit timeouts set above their maximum. You may see a
warning if your time out is capped by the driver but there is
currently no way to retrieve the capped value back from the driver.
.PP
Note that some drivers may not support this attribute.
.PP
See \fIt/20SqlServer.t\fR for an example.
.PP
\fIodbc_putdata_start\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_putdata_start"
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`odbc_putdata_start\*(C'\fR defines the size at which \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 uses
\&\f(CW\*(C`SQLPutData\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`SQLParamData\*(C'\fR to send larger objects to the
database instead of simply binding them as normal with
\&\f(CW\*(C`SQLBindParameter\*(C'\fR. It is mostly a placeholder for future changes
allowing chunks of data to be sent to the database and there is little
reason for anyone to change it currently.
.PP
The default for odbc_putdata_start is 32768 because this value was
hard-coded in \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 until 1.16_1.
.PP
\fIodbc_column_display_size\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_column_display_size"
.PP
If you \s-1ODBC\s0 driver does not support the \s-1SQL_COLUMN_DISPLAY_SIZE\s0 and
\&\s-1SQL_COLUMN_LENGTH\s0 attributes to SQLColAtrributes then \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 does
not know how big the column might be. odbc_column_display_size sets
the default value for the column size when retrieving column data
where the size cannot be determined.
.PP
The default for odbc_column_display_size is 2001 because this value was
hard-coded in \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 until 1.17_3.
.PP
\fIodbc_utf8_on\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_utf8_on"
.PP
Set this flag to treat all strings returned from the \s-1ODBC\s0 driver
(except columns described as \s-1SQL_BINARY\s0 or \s-1SQL_TIMESTAMP\s0 and its
variations) as \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded.  Some \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers (like Aster and maybe
PostgreSQL) return \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded data but do not support the SQLxxxW
unicode \s-1API.\s0 Enabling this flag will cause \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 to treat driver
returned data as \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded and it will be marked as such in Perl.
.PP
Do not confuse this with \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0's unicode support. The
\&\f(CW\*(C`odbc_utf8_on\*(C'\fR attribute only applies to non-unicode enabled builds
of \s-1DBD::ODBC.\s0
.PP
\fIodbc_describe_parameters\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_describe_parameters"
.PP
Defaults to on. When set this allows \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 to call SQLDescribeParam
(if the driver supports it) to retrieve information about any
parameters.
.PP
When off/false \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 will not call SQLDescribeParam and defaults
to binding parameters as \s-1SQL_CHAR/SQL_WCHAR\s0 depending on the build
type and whether your data is unicode or not.
.PP
You do not have to disable odbc_describe_parameters just because your
driver does not support SQLDescribeParam as \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 will work this
out at the start via SQLGetFunctions.
.PP
\&\fBNote\fR: disabling odbc_describe_parameters when your driver does support
SQLDescribeParam may prevent \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 binding parameters for some
column types properly.
.PP
You can also set this attribute in the attributes passed to the
prepare method.
.PP
This attribute was added so someone moving from freeTDS (a driver
which does not support SQLDescribeParam) to a driver which does
support SQLDescribeParam could do so without changing any Perl. The
situation was very specific since dates were being bound as dates when
SQLDescribeParam was called and chars without and the data format was
not a supported date format.

.PP
Introduced in 1.34_3.
.PP
This is just a wrapper around the \s-1ODBC API\s0 SQLGetDiagRec. When a
method on a connection or statement handle fails if there are any \s-1ODBC\s0
diagnostics you can use this method to retrieve them. Records start at
1 and there may be more than 1. It returns an array containing the
state, native and error message text or an empty array if the requested
diagnostic record does not exist. To get all diagnostics available
keep incrementing \f(CW$record_number\fR until odbc_getdiagrec returns an
empty array.
.PP
All of the state, native and message text are already passed to \s-1DBI\s0
via its set_err method so this method does not really tell you
anything you cannot already get from \s-1DBI\s0 except when there is more
than one diagnostic.
.PP
You may find this useful in an error handler as you can get the \s-1ODBC\s0
diagnostics as they are and not how \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 was forced to fit them
into the \s-1DBI\s0's system.

Allow error and informational diagnostics to be handled by the

from the last \s-1ODBC API.\s0 The fourth argument was added in 1.30_7.
.PP
If the error handler returns 0, the error is ignored, otherwise the

Be careful with this attribute as once set to anything larger than 1
(the default) you must retrieve all result-sets before the statement
handle goes out of scope or you can upset the \s-1TDS\s0 protocol and this
can result in a hang. With \s-1DBI\s0 this is unlikely as \s-1DBI\s0 warns when a
statement goes out of scope with outstanding results.

Thanks to Andrew Brown for the original patch.
.PP
\&\s-1DBD\s0 developer note: Here lies a bag of worms. Firstly, \s-1SQL_ROWSET_SIZE\s0
is an \s-1ODBC 2\s0 attribute and is usually a statement attribute not a
connection attribute. However, in \s-1ODBC 2.0\s0 you could set statement
attributes on a connection handle and it acted as a default for all
subsequent statement handles created under that connection handle. If
you are using \s-1ODBC 3\s0 the driver manager continues to map this call but
the \s-1ODBC\s0 Driver needs to act on it (the \s-1MS SQL\s0 Server driver still
appears to but some other \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers for \s-1MS SQL\s0 Server do not).
Secondly, somewhere a long the line \s-1MS\s0 decided it was no longer valid
to retrieve the \s-1SQL_ROWSET_SIZE\s0 attribute from a connection handle in
an \s-1ODBC 3\s0 application (which \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 now is). In itself, this would
not be a problem except for a minor bug in \s-1DBI\s0 which until release
1.616 mistakenly issued a \s-1FETCH\s0 on any attribute mentioned in the
connect method call. As a result, it you use a \s-1DBI\s0 prior to 1.616 and
attempt to set odbc_SQL_ROWSET_SIZE in the connect method call, \s-1DBI\s0
issues a \s-1FETCH\s0 on odbc_SQL_ROWSET_SIZE and the driver manager throws
it out as an invalid attribute thus resulting in an error. The only
way around this (other than upgrading \s-1DBI\s0) is to set
odbc_SQL_ROWSET_SIZE \s-1AFTER\s0 the call to connect. Thirdly, \s-1MS\s0 withdrew
the \s-1SQLROWSETSIZE\s0 macro from the sql header files in \s-1MDAC 2.7\s0 for 64
bit platforms i.e., \s-1SQLROWSETSIZE\s0 is not defined on 64 bit platforms
from \s-1MDAC 2.7\s0 as it is in a \*(L"#ifdef win32\*(R" (see
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en\-us/library/ms716287%28v=vs.85%29.aspx).
Setting \s-1SQL_ROWSET_SIZE\s0 still seems to take effect on 64 bit platforms
but you can no longer retrieve its value from a connection handle
(hence the issue above with \s-1DBI\s0 redundant \s-1FETCH\s0).

A read-only attribute signifying whether \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 was built with the

.IP "bind all string columns as wide characters (SQL_Wxxx)" 4
.IX Item "bind all string columns as wide characters (SQL_Wxxx)"
This means that \s-1UNICODE\s0 data stored in these columns will be returned
to Perl correctly as unicode (i.e., encoded in \s-1UTF\-8\s0 and the \s-1UTF\-8\s0 flag set).
.IP "bind parameters the database declares as wide characters or unicode parameters as SQL_Wxxx" 4

Parameters bound where the database declares the parameter as being a
wide character, or where the parameter data is unicode, or where the
parameter type is explicitly set to a wide type (e.g., SQL_Wxxx) are bound
as wide characters in the \s-1ODBC API\s0 and \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 encodes the perl parameters

Typically, applications (like \s-1MS\s0 Access and many others) which build a connection string via
dialogs and possibly SQLBrowseConnect eventually end up with a successful \s-1ODBC\s0 connection
to the \s-1ODBC\s0 driver and database. The odbc_out_connect_string provides a string

it allowed get_info and get_type_info to return correct/updated
information that \s-1ODBC 2\s0.x didn't permit/provide.  Since \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 is
now 3.x, this can be used to force 2.x behavior via something like: my
.PP
.Vb 2

\fIodbc_driver_complete\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_driver_complete"
.PP
This attribute was added to \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 in 1.32_2.
.PP
odbc_driver_complete is only relevant to the Windows operating system
and will be ignored on other platforms. It is off by default.
.PP
When set to a true value \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 attempts to obtain a window handle
and calls SQLDriverConnect with the \s-1SQL_DRIVER_COMPLETE\s0 attribute
instead of the normal \s-1SQL_DRIVER_NOPROMPT\s0 option. What this means is
that if the connection string does not describe sufficient attributes
to enable the \s-1ODBC\s0 driver manager to connect to a data source it will
throw a dialogue allowing you to input the remaining attributes. Once
you ok that dialogue the \s-1ODBC\s0 Driver Manager will continue as if you
specified those attributes in the connection string. Once the
connection is complete you may want to look at the odbc_out_connect_string
attribute to obtain a connection string you can use in the future to
pass into the connect method without prompting.
.PP
As a window handle is passed to SQLDriverConnect it also means the
\&\s-1ODBC\s0 driver may throw a dialogue e.g., if your password has expired
the \s-1MS SQL\s0 Server driver will often prompt for a new one.
.PP
An example is:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  my $h = DBI\->connect(\*(Aqdbi:ODBC:DRIVER={SQL Server}\*(Aq, "username", "password",
\&                       {odbc_driver_complete => 1});
.Ve
.PP
As this only provides the driver and further attributes are required a
dialogue will be thrown allowing you to specify the \s-1SQL\s0 Server to
connect to and possibly other attributes.
.PP
\fIodbc_batch_size\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_batch_size"
.PP
Sets the batch size for execute_for_fetch which defaults to 10.
Bear in mind the bigger you set this the more memory \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 will need
to allocate when running execute_for_fetch and the memory required is
max_length_of_pn * odbc_batch_size * n_parameters.
.PP
\fIodbc_array_operations\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_array_operations"
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 this was briefly odbc_disable_array_operations in 1.35 and 1.36_1.
I did warn it was experimental and it turned out the default was too
ambitious and it was a poor name anyway. Also the default was to use
array operations and now the default is the opposite.
.PP
If set to true \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 uses its own internal execute_for_fetch
instead of \s-1DBI\s0's default execute_for_fetch. The default is false.
Using the internal execute_for_fetch should be quite a bit faster when
using arrays of parameters for insert/update/delete operations as
batches of parameters are sent to the database in one go. However,
the required support in some \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers is a little sketchy and there
is no way for \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 to ascertain this until it is too late.
.PP
Please read the documentation on execute_array and execute_for_fetch
which details subtle differences in \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0's implementation compared
with using \s-1DBI\s0's default implementation. If these difference cause you
a problem you can set odbc_array_operations to false and \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0
will revert to \s-1DBI\s0's implementations of the array methods.
.PP
You can use the environment variable \s-1ODBC_DISABLE_ARRAY_OPERATIONS\s0 to
switch array operations on/off too. When set to 1 array operations are
disabled. When not set the default is used (which currently is off).
When set to 0 array operations are used no matter what. I know this is
slightly counter intuitive but I've found it difficult to change the
name (it got picked up and used in a few places very quickly).

\fIodbc_taf_callback\fR

.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 this is experimental until I at least see more than one \s-1ODBC\s0
driver which supports \s-1TAF.\s0
.PP
Transparent Application Failover (\s-1TAF\s0) is a feature in \s-1OCI\s0 that
allows for clients to automatically reconnect to an instance in the
event of a failure of the instance. The reconnect happens
automatically from within the \s-1OCI \s0(Oracle Call Interface)
library.
.PP
\&\s-1TAF\s0 supports a callback function which once registered is called
by the driver to let you know what is happening and which allows
you to a degree, to control how the failover is handled.
.PP
You need to set up \s-1TAF\s0 on your instance first and that process
is beyond the scope of this document. Once \s-1TAF\s0 is enabled you simply
set \f(CW\*(C`odbc_taf_callback\*(C'\fR to a code reference which should look like
this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  sub taf_handler {
\&   my ($dbh, $event, $type) = @_;
\&   # do something here
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 will pass the connection handle ($dbh), the Oracle event
type (\s-1OCI_FO_END, OCI_FO_ABORT, OCI_FO_REAUTH, OCI_FO_BEGIN,
OCI_FO_ERROR\s0) and the Oracle type (\s-1OCI_FO_NONE, OCI_FO_SESSION,
OCI_FO_SELECT, OCI_FO_TXNAL\s0).  Consult the Oracle documentation for
what these are. You can import these constants using the :taf export
tag. If your instance is not \s-1TAF\s0 enabled it is likely an attempt to
register a callback will fail but this is driver dependent (all
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 does is make a SQLSetConnectAttr call and provide a C
wrapper which calls your Perl subroutine).
.PP
Here is a commented example:
.PP
.Vb 7

to \s-1SQL_C_BINARY\s0 for binary columns and \s-1SQL_C_CHAR/SQL_C_WCHAR\s0 for
other column types depending on whether \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 is built with
unicode support. \f(CW$chrs_or_bytes_read\fR will by the bytes read when
the column types \s-1SQL_C_CHAR\s0 or \s-1SQL_C_BINARY\s0 are used and characters
read if the column type is \s-1SQL_C_WCHAR.\s0
.PP
When built with unicode support \f(CW$length\fR specifies the amount of
buffer space to be used when retrieving the lob data but as it is
returned as \s-1SQLWCHAR\s0 characters this means you at most retrieve
\&\f(CW\*(C`$length/2\*(C'\fR characters. When those retrieved characters are encoded
in \s-1UTF\-8\s0 for Perl, the \f(CW$lob\fR scalar may need to be larger than
\&\f(CW$length\fR so \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 grows it appropriately.
.PP
You can retrieve a lob in chunks like this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  $sth\->bind_col($column, undef, {TreatAsLOB=>1});
\&  while(my $retrieved = $sth\->odbc_lob_read($column, \emy $data, $length)) {
\&      print "retrieved=$retrieved lob_data=$data\en";
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 to retrieve a lob like this you \fBmust\fR first bind the lob
column specifying BindAsLOB or \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 will 1) bind the column as
normal and it will be subject to LongReadLen and b) fail
odbc_lob_read.
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 Some database engines and \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers do not allow you to
retrieve columns out of order (e.g., \s-1MS SQL\s0 Server unless you are
using cursors).  In those cases you must ensure the lob retrieved is
the last (or only) column in your select list.
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 You can retrieve only part of a lob but you will probably have
to call finish on the statement handle before you do anything else
with that statement. When only retrieving part of a large lob you
could see a small delay when you call finish as some protocols used
by \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers send the lob down the socket synchronously and there is
no way to stop it (this means the \s-1ODBC\s0 driver needs to read all the
lob from the socket even though you never retrieved it all yourself).
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 If your select contains multiple lobs you cannot read part of
the first lob, the second lob then return to the first lob. You must
read all lobs in order and completely or read part of a lob and then
do no further calls to odbc_lob_read.

If you bind a column as a specific type (\s-1SQL_INTEGER, SQL_DOUBLE\s0 and

\&\s-1SQL_C_LONG\s0 and DiscardString is irrelevant.
.PP
This is especially useful if you are using a module which uses a
scalar's flags and/or pv to decide if a scalar is a number. \s-1JSON::XS\s0
does this and without this flag you have to add 0 to all bound column
data returning numbers to get \s-1JSON::XS\s0 to encode it is N instead of

\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 now supports the parse_trace_flag and parse_trace_flags
methods introduced in \s-1DBI 1.42 \s0(see \s-1DBI\s0 for a full description).  As
of \s-1DBI 1.604,\s0 the only trace flag defined which is relevant to
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 is '\s-1SQL\s0' which \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 supports by outputting the \s-1SQL\s0
strings (after modification) passed to the prepare and do methods.
.PP
From \s-1DBI 1.617 DBI\s0 also defines \s-1ENC \s0(encoding), \s-1CON \s0(connection) \s-1TXN
\&\s0(transaction) and \s-1DBD \s0(\s-1DBD\s0 only) trace flags. \s-1DBI\s0's \s-1ENC\s0 and \s-1CON\s0 trace
flags are synonymous with \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0's odbcunicode and odbcconnection
trace flags though I may remove the \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 ones in the
future. \s-1DBI\s0's \s-1DBD\s0 trace flag allows output of only \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 trace
messages without \s-1DBI\s0's trace messages.
.PP
Currently \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 supports two private trace flags. The
\&'odbcunicode' flag traces some unicode operations and the
odbcconnection traces the connect process.
.PP
To enable tracing of particular flags you use:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $h\->trace($h\->parse_trace_flags(\*(AqSQL|odbcconnection\*(Aq));
\&  $h\->trace($h\->parse_trace_flags(\*(Aq1|odbcunicode\*(Aq));

In the first case '\s-1SQL\s0' and 'odbcconnection' tracing is enabled on
\&\f(CW$h\fR. In the second case trace level 1 is set and 'odbcunicode' tracing
is enabled.
.PP
If you want to enable a \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 private trace flag before connecting
you need to do something like:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  use DBD::ODBC;

From \s-1DBI 1.617\s0 you can output only \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 trace messages using
.PP

\fIComments in \s-1SQL\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "Comments in SQL"
.PP
\&\s-1DBI\s0 does not say anything in particular about comments in \s-1SQL.
DBD::ODBC\s0 looks for placeholders in the \s-1SQL\s0 string and until 1.24_2 it
did not recognise comments in \s-1SQL\s0 strings so could find what it
believes to be a placeholder in a comment e.g.,
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  select \*(Aq1\*(Aq /* placeholder ? in comment */
\&  select \-\- named placeholder :named in comment
\&    \*(Aq1\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
I cannot be exact about support for ignoring placeholders in literals
but it has existed for a long time in \s-1DBD::ODBC.\s0 Support for ignoring
placeholders in comments was added in 1.24_2. If you find a case where
a named placeholder is not ignored and should be, see

.PP
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 implements \f(CW\*(C`do\*(C'\fR by calling SQLExecDirect in \s-1ODBC\s0 and not
SQLPrepare followed by SQLExecute so \f(CW\*(C`do\*(C'\fR is not the same as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh\->prepare($sql)\->execute()
.Ve
.PP
It does this to avoid a round-trip to the server so it is faster.
Normally this is good but some people fall foul of this with \s-1MS SQL\s0
Server if they call a procedure which outputs print statements (e.g.,
backup) as the procedure may not complete. See the \s-1DBD::ODBC FAQ\s0 and
in general you are better to use prepare/execute when calling
procedures.
.PP
In addition, you should realise that since \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 does not create a
\&\s-1DBI\s0 statement for do calls, if you set up an error handler the handle
passed in when a do fails will be the database handle and not
a statement handle.

There are 3 conventions for place holders in \s-1DBI.\s0 These are '?', ':N'
and ':name' (where 'N' is a number and 'name' is an alpha numeric
string not beginning with a number). \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 supports all these methods
for naming placeholders but you must only use one method throughout
a particular \s-1SQL\s0 string. If you mix placeholder methods you will get

.PP
Although the \s-1DBI\s0 documentation (as of 1.604) does not say how named
parameters are bound Tim Bunce has said that in Oracle they are bound

.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 does allow a parameter to be rebound with another data type as

\&  # parameter 1 set as a SQL_LONGVARCHAR
\&  $sth\->bind_param(1, $data, DBI::SQL_LONGVARCHAR);
\&  # without the bind above the $data parameter would be either a DBD::ODBC

\&  # parameter types are sticky, the type is still SQL_LONGVARCHAR.

SQLDisconnect returns state 25000 (transaction in progress).
.PP
\fIexecute_for_fetch and execute_array\fR
.IX Subsection "execute_for_fetch and execute_array"
.PP
From version 1.34_1 \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 implements its own execute_for_fetch
which binds arrays of parameters and can send multiple rows
(\*(L"odbc_batch_size\*(R") of parameters through the \s-1ODBC\s0 driver in one go
(this overrides \s-1DBI\s0's default execute_for_fetch). This is much faster
when inserting, updating or deleting many rows in one go. Note,
execute_array uses execute_for_fetch when the parameters are passed
for column-wise binding.
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE: DBD::ODBC 1.34_1\s0 to \s-1DBD::ODBC 1.36_1\s0 set the default to use
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0's own execute_for_fetch but quite a few \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers just
cannot handle it. As such, from \s-1DBD::ODBC 1.36_2\s0 the default was
changed to not use \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0's execute_for_fetch (i.e., you need to
enable it with \*(L"odbc_array_operations\*(R").
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 Some \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers don't support setting \s-1SQL_ATTR_PARAMSET_SIZE \s0>
1, and hence cannot support binding arrays of parameters. The only way
to detect this is to attempt to set \s-1SQL_ATTR_PARAMSET_SIZE\s0 to a value
greater than 1 and it is too late once someone has called
execute_for_fetch. I don't want to add test code on each connect to
test for this as it will affect everyone, even those not using the
native execute_for_fetch so for now it is a suck it and see. For your
information \s-1MS\s0 Access which does not support arrays of parameters
errors with \s-1HY092, \s0\*(L"Invalid attribute/option identifier\*(R".
.PP
However, there are a small number of differences between using
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0's execute_for_fetch compared with using \s-1DBI\s0's default
implementation (which simply calls execute repeatedly once per row).
The differences you may see are:
.PP
o as \s-1DBI\s0's execute_for_fetch does one row at a time the result from
execute is for one row and just about all \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers can report the
number of affected rows when SQLRowCount is called per execute. When
batches of parameters are sent the driver can still return the number
of affected rows but it is usually per batch rather than per row. As a
result, the tuple_status array you may pass to execute_for_fetch (or
execute_array) usually shows \-1 (unknown) for each row although the total
affected returned in array context is a correct total affected.
.PP
o not all \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers have sufficient \s-1ODBC\s0 support (arguably a bug)
for correct diagnostics support when using arrays. \s-1DBI\s0 dictates that
if a row in the batch is in error the tuple_status will contain the
state, native and error message text. However the batch may generate
multiple errors per row (which \s-1DBI\s0 says nothing about) and more than
one row may error. In \s-1ODBC\s0 we get a list of errors but to associate
each one with a particular row we need to call SQLGetDiagField for
\&\s-1SQL_DIAG_ROW_NUMBER\s0 and it should say which row in the batch the
diagnostic is associated with. Some \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers do not support
\&\s-1SQL_DIAG_ROW_NUMBER\s0 properly and then \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 cannot know which row
in the batch an error refers to. In this case \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 will report an
error saying \*(L"failed to retrieve diags\*(R", state of \s-1HY000\s0 and a native
of 1 so you'll still see an error but not necessarily the exact
one. Also, when more than one diagnostic is found for a row \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0
picks the first one (which is usually most relevant) as there is no
way to report more than one diagnostic per row in the tuple_status. If
the first problem of \s-1SQL_DIAG_ROW_NUMBER\s0 proves to be a problem for
you the \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 tracing will show all errors and you can also use
\&\*(L"odbc_getdiagrec\*(R" yourself.
.PP
o Binding parameters with execute_array and execute_for_fetch does not
allow the parameter types to be set. However, as parameter types are sticky
you can call bind_param(param_num, undef, {\s-1TYPE\s0 => sql_type}) before
calling execute_for_fetch/execute_array and the \s-1TYPE\s0 should be sticky
when the batch of parameters is bound.
.PP
o Although you can insert very large columns execute_for_fetch will
need \*(L"odbc_batch_size\*(R" * max length of parameter per parameter so
you may hit memory limits. If you use \s-1DBI\s0's execute_for_fetch
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 uses the \s-1ODBC API\s0 SQLPutData (see \*(L"odbc_putdata_start\*(R")
which does not require large amounts of memory as large columns are
sent in pieces.
.PP
o A lot of drivers have bugs with arrays of parameters (see the \s-1ODBC
FAQ\s0). e.g., as of 18\-MAR\-2012 I've seen the latest SQLite \s-1ODBC\s0 driver
seg fault and freeTDS 8/0.91 returns the wrong row count for batches.
.PP
o \fB\s-1DO NOT\s0\fR attempt to do an insert/update/delete and a select in the

\fItype_info_all\fR
.IX Subsection "type_info_all"
.PP
Many \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers now return 20 columns in type_info_all rather than
the 19 \s-1DBI\s0 documents. The 20th column is usually called
\&\*(L"\s-1USERTYPE\*(R". \s0 Recent \s-1MS SQL\s0 Server \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers do this. Fortunately
this should not adversely affect you so long as you are using the keys
provided at the start of type_info_all.
.PP
\fIBinding Columns\fR
.IX Subsection "Binding Columns"
.PP
The \s-1DBI\s0 specification allows a column type to be overridden in the call
to the bind_col method. Mostly, \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 ignores this type as it
binds integers (\s-1SQL_INTEGER\s0) as a \s-1SQL_C_LONG \s0(since \s-1DBD::ODBC 1.38_1\s0)
and all other columns as \s-1SQL_C_CHAR\s0 or \s-1SQL_C_WCHAR\s0 and it is too late
to change the bind type after the result-set has been described
anyway. The only time when the \s-1TYPE\s0 passed to bind_col is used in
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 is when it is \s-1SQL_NUMERIC\s0 or \s-1SQL_DOUBLE\s0 in which case
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 will call \s-1DBI\s0's sql_type_cast method.
.PP
Since \s-1DBD::ODBC 1.38_1\s0 if you attempt to change the bind type after
the column has already bound \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 will issue a warning and ignore
your column type change e.g.,
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  my $s = $h\->prepare(q/select a from mytable);
\&  $s\->execute;  # The column type was determined here
\&  my $r;
\&  $s\->bind_col(1, \e$r); # and bound as the right type here
\&  $s\->execute;
\&  $s\->bind_col(1, \e$r, {TYPE => SQL_XXX}); # warning, type changed
.Ve
.PP
Basically, if you are passing a \s-1TYPE\s0 to bind_col with \s-1DBD::ODBC \s0(other
than \s-1SQL_NUMERIC\s0 or \s-1SQL_DOUBLE\s0) your code is probably wrong.
.PP
Significant changes occurred in \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 at 1.38_1 for binding
columns. Please see the Changes file.
.PP
\fIbind_param\fR
.IX Subsection "bind_param"
.PP
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 follows the \s-1DBI\s0 specification for bind_param however the
third argument (a type or a hashref containing a type) is loosely
defined by \s-1DBI.\s0 From the \s-1DBI\s0 pod:
.PP
\&\fIThe \e%attr parameter can be used to hint at the data type the placeholder should have. This is rarely needed. \fR
.PP
As a general rule, don't specify a type when calling bind_param. If you stick to inserting appropriate data into the appropriate column \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 will mostly do the right thing especially if the \s-1ODBC\s0 driver supports SQLDescribeParam.
.PP
In particular don't just add a type of \s-1SQL_DATE\s0 because you are inserting a date (it will not work). The correct syntax in \s-1ODBC\s0 for inserting dates, times and timestamps is:
.PP
insert into mytable (mydate, mttime, mytimestamp) values(?,?,?);
bind_param(1, \*(L"{d '\s-1YYYY\-MM\-DD\s0'}\*(R");
bind_param(2, \*(L"{t '\s-1HH:MM:SS.MM\s0'}\*(R"); # :MM can be omitted and some dbs support :MMM
bind_param(3, \*(L"{ts '\s-1YYYY\-MM\-DD HH:MM:SS\s0'}\*(R");
.PP
See http://technet.microsoft.com/en\-US/library/ms190234%28v=SQL.90%29.aspx
.PP
The only times when you might want to add a type are:
.PP
1. If your \s-1ODBC\s0 driver does not support SQLDescribeParam (or if you
told \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 not to use it) then \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 will default to inserting
each parameter as a string (which is usually the right thing
anyway). This is ok, most of the time, but is probably not what you
want when inserting a binary (use \s-1TYPE\s0 => \s-1SQL_BINARY\s0).
.PP
2. If for some reason your driver describes the parameter
incorrectly. It is difficult to describe an example of this.
.PP
3. If SQLDescribeParam is supported but fails e.g., \s-1MS SQL\s0 Server has
problems with \s-1SQL\s0 like \*(L"select myfunc(?) where 1 = 1\*(R".
.PP
Also, \s-1DBI\s0 exports some types which are not available in \s-1ODBC\s0 e.g.,
\&\s-1SQL_BLOB.\s0 If you are unsure about \s-1ODBC\s0 types look at your \s-1ODBC\s0 header
files or look up valid types in the \s-1ODBC\s0 specification.
.SS "Unicode"
.IX Subsection "Unicode"
The \s-1ODBC\s0 specification supports wide character versions (a postfix of
\&'W') of some of the normal \s-1ODBC\s0 APIs e.g., SQLDriverConnectW is a wide
character version of SQLDriverConnect.
.PP
In \s-1ODBC\s0 on Windows the wide characters are defined as SQLWCHARs (2
bytes) and are \s-1UCS\-2 \s0(but \s-1UTF\-16\s0 is accepted by some drivers now e.g.,
\&\s-1MS SQL\s0 Server 2012 and the new collation suffix _SC which stands for
Supplementary Character Support). On non-Windows, the main driver
managers I know of have implemented the wide character APIs
differently:
.IP "unixODBC" 4
.IX Item "unixODBC"
unixODBC mimics the Windows \s-1ODBC API\s0 precisely meaning the wide
character versions expect and return 2\-byte characters in
\&\s-1UCS\-2\s0 or \s-1UTF\-16.\s0
.Sp
unixODBC will happily recognise \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers which only have the \s-1ANSI\s0
versions of the \s-1ODBC API\s0 and those that have the wide versions
too.
.Sp
unixODBC will allow an \s-1ANSI\s0 application to work with a unicode
\&\s-1ODBC\s0 driver and vice versa (although in the latter case you obviously
cannot actually use unicode).
.Sp
unixODBC does not prevent you sending \s-1UTF\-8\s0 in the \s-1ANSI\s0 versions of
the \s-1ODBC\s0 APIs but whether that is understood by your \s-1ODBC\s0 driver is
another matter.
.Sp
unixODBC differs in only one way from the Microsoft \s-1ODBC\s0 driver in
terms of unicode support in that it avoids unnecessary translations
between single byte and double byte characters when an \s-1ANSI\s0
application is using a unicode-aware \s-1ODBC\s0 driver by requiring unicode
applications to signal their intent by calling SQLDriverConnectW
first. On Windows, the \s-1ODBC\s0 driver manager always uses the wide
versions of the \s-1ODBC API\s0 in \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers which provide the wide
versions regardless of what the application really needs and this
results in a lot of unnecessary character translations when you have
an \s-1ANSI\s0 application and a unicode \s-1ODBC\s0 driver.

such.
.IP "metadata calls like table_info, column_info" 4
.IX Item "metadata calls like table_info, column_info"
As of \s-1DBD::ODBC 1.32_3\s0 meta data calls accept Unicode strings.

Since version 1.16_4, the default parameter bind type is \s-1SQL_WVARCHAR\s0
for unicode builds of \s-1DBD::ODBC.\s0 This only affects \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers which

specifically set a \s-1SQL\s0 type on the bind_param method call.

\fIUnicode \- Caveats\fR
.IX Subsection "Unicode - Caveats"
.PP
For Unicode support on any platform in Perl you will need at least
Perl 5.8.1 \- sorry but this is the way it is with Perl.
.PP
The Unicode support in \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 expects a \s-1WCHAR\s0 to be 2 bytes (as it
is on Windows and as the \s-1ODBC\s0 specification suggests it is). Until
\&\s-1ODBC\s0 specifies any other Unicode support it is not envisioned this
will change.  On \s-1UNIX\s0 there are a few different \s-1ODBC\s0 driver
managers. I have only tested the unixODBC driver manager
(http://www.unixodbc.org) with Unicode support and it was built with
defaults which set \s-1WCHAR\s0 as 2 bytes.
.PP
I believe that the iODBC driver manager expects wide characters to be
wchar_t types (which are usually 4 bytes) and hence \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 will not
work iODBC when built for unicode.
.PP
The \s-1ODBC\s0 Driver must expect Unicode data specified in SQLBindParameter
and SQLBindCol to be \s-1UTF\-16\s0 in local endianness. Similarly, in calls to
SQLPrepareW, SQLDescribeColW and SQLDriverConnectW.
.PP
You should be aware that once Unicode support is enabled it affects a
number of \s-1DBI\s0 methods (some of which you might not expect). For
instance, when listing tables, columns etc some drivers
(e.g. Microsoft \s-1SQL\s0 Server) will report the column types as wide types
even if the strings actually fit in 7\-bit \s-1ASCII.\s0 As a result, there is
an overhead for retrieving this column data as 2 bytes per character
will be transmitted (compared with 1 when Unicode support is not
enabled) and these strings will be converted into \s-1UTF\-8\s0 but will end up
fitting (in most cases) into 7bit \s-1ASCII\s0 so a lot of conversion work
has been performed for nothing. If you don't have Unicode table and
column names or Unicode column data in your tables you are best
disabling Unicode support.
.PP
I am at present unsure if ChopBlanks processing on Unicode strings is
working correctly on \s-1UNIX.\s0 If nothing else the construct L' ' in
dbdimp.c might not work with all \s-1UNIX\s0 compilers. Reports of issues and
patches welcome.

\fIUnicode implementation in \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0\fR

.PP
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 uses the wide character versions of the \s-1ODBC API\s0 and the
\&\s-1SQL_WCHAR ODBC\s0 type to support unicode in Perl.
.PP
Wide characters returned from the \s-1ODBC\s0 driver will be converted to
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 and the perl scalars will have the utf8 flag set (by using
sv_utf8_decode).
.PP
\&\fB\s-1IMPORTANT\s0\fR
.PP
Perl scalars which are \s-1UTF\-8\s0 and are sent through the \s-1ODBC API\s0 will be
converted to \s-1UTF\-16\s0 and passed to the \s-1ODBC\s0 wide APIs or signalled as
SQL_WCHARs (e.g., in the case of bound columns). Retrieved data which
are wide characters are converted from \s-1UTF\-16\s0 to \s-1UTF\-8.\s0 However, you
should realise most \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers do not support \s-1UTF\-16, ODBC\s0 only
talks about wide characters being 2 bytes and \s-1UCS\-2\s0 and \s-1UCS\-2\s0 and
\&\s-1UTF\-16\s0 are not the same. \s-1UCS\-2\s0 only supports Unicode characters in the
first plane (the Basic Multilangual Plane or \s-1BMP\s0) (code points U+0000
to U+FFFF), the most frequently used characters. So why does \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0
currently encode in \s-1UTF\-16\s0? For around 97% of Unicode characters in
the range 0\-0xFFFF \s-1UCS\-2\s0 and \s-1UTF\-16\s0 are exactly the same (and where they
differ there is no valid Unicode character as the range U+D800 to U+DFFF is
reserved from use only as surrogate pairs). As the \s-1ODBC
API\s0 currently uses \s-1UCS\-2\s0 it does not support Unicode characters with
code points above 0xFFFF (if you know better I'd like to hear from
you). However, because \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 uses \s-1UTF\-16\s0 encoding you can still
insert Unicode characters above 0xFFFF into your database and retrieve
them back correctly but they may not being treated as a single
Unicode character in your database e.g., a \*(L"select length(a_column)
from table\*(R" with a single Unicode character above 0xFFFF may
return 2 and not 1 so you cannot use database functions on that
data like upper/lower/length etc but you can at least save the data in
your database and get it back.
.PP
When built for unicode, \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 will always call SQLDriverConnectW
(and not SQLDriverConnect) even if a) your connection string is not
unicode b) you have not got a \s-1DBI\s0 later than 1.607, because unixODBC
requires SQLDriverConnectW to be called if you want to call other
unicode \s-1ODBC\s0 APIs later. As a result, if you build for unicode and
pass \s-1ASCII\s0 strings to the connect method they will be converted to
\&\s-1UTF\-16\s0 and passed to SQLDriverConnectW. This should make no real
difference to perl not using unicode connection strings.
.PP
You will need a \s-1DBI\s0 later than 1.607 to support unicode connection
strings because until post 1.607 there was no way for \s-1DBI\s0 to pass

There are a number of ways you may help with the development and
maintenance of this module:
.IP "Submitting patches" 4
.IX Item "Submitting patches"
Please send me a git pull request or email a unified diff.
.Sp
Please try and include a test which demonstrates the fix/change
working.
.IP "Reporting installs" 4
.IX Item "Reporting installs"
Install CPAN::Reporter and report you installations. This is easy to
do \- see \*(L"\s-1CPAN\s0 Testers Reporting\*(R".
.IP "Report bugs" 4
.IX Item "Report bugs"
If you find what you believe is a bug then enter it into the
<http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Name=DBD\-ODBC> system. Where
possible include code which reproduces the problem including any
schema required and the versions of software you are using.
.Sp
If you are unsure whether you have found a bug report it anyway or
post it to the dbi-users mailing list.
.IP "pod comments and corrections" 4
.IX Item "pod comments and corrections"
If you find inaccuracies in the \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 pod or have a comment which
you think should be added then go to <http://annocpan.org> and submit
them there. I get an email for every comment added and will review
each one and apply any changes to the documentation.
.IP "Review \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0" 4
.IX Item "Review DBD::ODBC"
Add your review of \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 on <http://cpanratings.perl.org>.
.Sp
If you are a member on ohloh then add your review or register your
use of \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 at <http://www.ohloh.net/projects/perl_dbd_odbc>.
.IP "submit test cases" 4
.IX Item "submit test cases"
Most DBDs are built against a single client library for the database.
.Sp
Unlike other DBDs, \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 works with many different \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers.
Although they all should be written with regard to the \s-1ODBC\s0
specification drivers have bugs and in some places the specification is
open to interpretation. As a result, when changes are applied to
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 it is very easy to break something in one \s-1ODBC\s0 driver.
.Sp
What helps enormously to identify problems in the many combinations
of \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 and \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers is a large test suite. I would greatly
appreciate any test cases and in particular any new test cases for
databases other than \s-1MS SQL\s0 Server.
.IP "Test \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0" 4
.IX Item "Test DBD::ODBC"
I have a lot of problems deciding when to move a development release
to an official release since I get few test reports for development
releases. What often happens is I call for testers on various lists,
get a few and then get inundated with requests to do an official
release. Then I do an official release and loads of rts appear out of
nowhere and the cycle starts again.
.Sp
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 by its very nature works with many \s-1ODBC\s0 Drivers and it is
impossible for me to have and test them all (this differs from other
DBDs). If you depend on \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 you should be interested in new
releases and if you send me your email address suggesting you are
prepared to be part of the \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 testing network I will credit you
in the Changes file and perhaps the main \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 file.
.SS "\s-1CPAN\s0 Testers Reporting"
.IX Subsection "CPAN Testers Reporting"
Please, please, please (is that enough), consider installing
CPAN::Reporter so that when you install perl modules a report of the
installation success or failure can be sent to cpan testers. In this
way module authors 1) get feedback on the fact that a module is being
installed 2) get to know if there are any installation problems. Also
other people like you may look at the test reports to see how
successful they are before choosing the version of a module to
install.

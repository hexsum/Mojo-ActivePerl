In general, on Windows, it's best to just use ActiveState Perl and the

So far I have managed to get it to Makefile and compile test and install and work.  However it seems one needs to set \*(L"\s-1NLS_LANG\*(R"\s0 to a valid value  
in the environment variables.
.PP
As well \s-1IC 11\s0 seems to have trouble finding the .ORA files. A quick fix for this is to add \*(L"\s-1TNS_ADMIN\*(R" \s0
to the environment variables and point it to where your .ORA files are.

\&    DBD\-Oracle for Windows and Oracle Instantclient and 10XE (Express Edition)
\&    By: John Scoles 
\&    The Pythian Group
.Ve
.PP
The preferred method of getting DBD::Oracle is to use a pre-built version from the ActiveState 
repository, which can be installed with \s-1PPM. \s0
.PP
Compiling and installing DBD::Oracle 1.18 or later on a windows 2000 professional or \s-1XP OS\s0 for use 
with Oracle instantClient ver 10.2.0.1 & 10.1.0.5 or Oracle \s-1XE\s0 requires only a few downloads and 
a minimal number of environment setting.  The procedures below were tested on a clean 
Windows platform having no Oracle or other development environment installed.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    1) The first part of the process is to download and install the latest version of 
\&    Active Perl from http://www.activeperl.com/.
\&
\&    2) Use the PPM application to get the latest version of DBI
\&
\&    3) Download the latest DBD::Oracle from http://svn.perl.org/modules/dbd\-oracle/trunk/
\&
\&    4) Download and unzip the Oracle Instant Client (10.2.0.1 or 10.1.0.5) 32 bit from 
\&    http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/oci/instantclient/instantclient.html 
\&    You will need all three of these products
\&        i.      Instant Client Package \- Basic
\&        ii.     Instant Client Package \- SQL*Plus:
\&        iii.    Instant Client Package \- SDK:
\&    or 
\&    
\&    install oracle 10XE http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/xe/index.html 
\&
\&    5) You will now need the Microsoft Visual C++ toolkit 2003. Unfortunately this product is no longer available from Microsoft.  
\&    The file name was VCToolkitSetup.exe  and is available at this mirror site http://www.filewatcher.com/m/VCToolkitSetup.exe.32952488.0.0.html at the time of writing.
\&    Microsoft\*(Aqs replacement for this tool kit is Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition and all attempts to compile DBD::Oracle with this product fail. It has been successfully compiled
\&    using a complete edition of Microsoft Visual Studio 2005. 
\&    Download and then install this product.
\&
\&    6) You will also need the Windows SDK. Which can be found at 
\&    http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=A55B6B43\-E24F\-4EA3\-A93E\-40C0EC4F68E5&displaylang=en
\&    You have the choice to of either to download the entire SDK and install or run an online install from the page.  
\&    Both have been tested and proven to work. 
\&
\&    7) Next download and install the Microsoft .net framework 1.1 skd from 
\&    http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b3a2ca6\-3647\-4070\-9f41\-a333c6b9181d&displaylang=en 
\&
\&    8) You will also need a copy of nmake.exe which you can download here http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/patch/1.52/w95/en\-us/nmake15.exe
\&
\&    9) Enough Downloading and installing go have a coffee.
\&
\&    10) You should at this time attempt to connect to an Oracle database with the version SQL*Plus that 
\&    you installed in step 4.  If you are unable to connect at this stage then any problems you encounter 
\&    later may have nothing to do with DBD::Oracle
\&
\&    11) On the path where you installed Visual C++ find and edit the vcvars32.bat file as follows.  You may have to modify 
\&        these path values depending where you installed the products on you computer, 
\&
\&        i.   Add  the local path to the windows platform SDK include directory to the Set INCLUDE 
\&                Command Line to include the needed files from the Windows SDK. 
\&                
\&                e.g.  "C:\eProgram Files\eMicrosoft Platform SDK\eInclude;" 
\&                
\&        ii.  Add the local path to the .net Vc7 lib directory to the Set LIB command
\&                to include the needed library file from the .Net SKD
\&                
\&                e.g. C:\eProgram Files\eMicrosoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\eVc7\elib;
\&                
\&            iii. Add the local path to the windows platform SDK Lib directory to the Set Lib command 
\&                to include the needed library files from the Windows SDK
\&                
\&            e.g. C:\eProgram Files\eMicrosoft Platform SDK\eLib;
\&
\&    12) Open a Windows Visual C++ command window from the start menu.
\&
\&    13) Add the path to the instant client to the Path command. If you are compiling aginst a 10XE db/client then you can skip steps 
\&        12 to 14. 
\&        e.g.  PATH = C:/Oracle/instantclient;%PATH%
\&    
\&    14) Using the "Set" command add "ORACLE_HOME=path to Instant client" to the environment variables.
\&        e.g. Set ORACLE_HOME=C:\eOracle\einstantclient
\&    
\&    15) Using the "Set" command add "NLS_LANG=.WE8ISO8859P15" to the environment variables. The globalization variable is required, 
\&        with this or another compatible value, by Oracle instantclient in order for it to compile correctly.
\&        e.g. Set NLS_LANG=.WE8ISO8859P15
\&
\&    16) Using the "Set" command add "ORACLE_USERID=test/test@test" substituting test with the username/password@database 
\&        you wish to run the make test files against. 
\&            Note: it is not necessary to do this step for the compile and install to work. 
\&        However: The self\-test programs included with Oracle\-DBD will mostly fail.
\&
\&    17) Move to the DBD\-Oracle directory in the Visual C++ window DOS prompt and enter the following.
\&
\&                c:\eoracle\-dbd\e>perl Makefile.PL  
\&
\&        The Makefile should then run and compile Oracle\-dbd without reporting any errors.
\&
\&    18) From this DOS prompt enter the following command
\&
\&            c:\eoracle\-dbd\e>nmake
\&
\&        The Visual C++ make executable will then build you DBD\-execuable. There should be no errors at this point.
\&
\&    19) You can test the compile by either entering
\&
\&            c:\eoracle\-dbd\e>nmake test
\&
\&        As long as you have given a valid user name, password and database name in step 15 you will see some results.  If it appears to
\&        run but you do not get a connection check the following.
\&
\&            i.   User name password and DB Name 
\&            ii.  Ensure the a valid TNSNAMES.ORA file is in the Instantclient directory
\&            iii. Attempt to log into the version of SQLPLUS that comes with Instantclient.  
\&                        If you manage to log on use the username password and TNS name with 
\&                        the Set ORACLE_USERID = and rerun the tests.
\&                    iv   If you are compiling against 10XE and have skiped steps 12 to 14 try again bu this time carry out these steps
\&
\&    20) You can now install DBD\-Oracle into you system by entering the following command from the Visual C++ window dos prompt;
\&
\&                c:\eoracle\-dbd\e>nmake install
\&
\&    21) You should now be able to run DBD\-Oracle on you system

Oracle Instant client (10.1.0.5)
.PP
The problem is in Makefile.PL. In line 130 the function find_oracle_home
is used to guess a value form \f(CW$ORACLE_HOME\fR if it is not set explicitly.
This value is used in line 138 to setup the environment (regardless
which client is used).
.PP
in line 1443 (sub get_client_version) sqlplus is used to get the
version string, but for the oracle instant client you must not set
\&\f(CW$ORACLE_HOME\fR (it will generate an error \*(L"\s-1SP2\-0642:\s0 SQL*Plus internal
error state 2165, context 4294967295:0:0\*(R")
.PP
A solution that worked for me was to set
local \f(CW$ENV\fR{\s-1ORACLE_HOME\s0} = '';
in line 1463 immediately before sqlplus is called (but I cannot tell if
this fails for full client installations)

No big problem here as 10XE seems to use the instantclient as well. Just ensure your

Makefile.PL uses Win32::TieRegistry or Win32::Registry to find the
current Oracle Home directory if the \s-1ORACLE_HOME\s0 environment variable
is not set.  If neither module is installed, you must set \s-1ORACLE_HOME\s0
before running Makefile.PL.  Since the registry location of the current
Oracle Home is in different locations in different Oracle versions,
it is usually safer to set \s-1ORACLE_HOME\s0 before running Makefile.PL.

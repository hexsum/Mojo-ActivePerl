The \f(CW$ru_who\fR argument is either \f(CW\*(C`RUSAGE_SELF\*(C'\fR (the current process) or
\&\f(CW\*(C`RUSAGE_CHILDREN\*(C'\fR (all the child processes of the current process)
or it maybe left away in which case \f(CW\*(C`RUSAGE_SELF\*(C'\fR is used.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`RUSAGE_CHILDREN\*(C'\fR is the total sum of all the so far
\&\fIterminated\fR (either successfully or unsuccessfully) child processes:
there is no way to find out information about child processes still
running.
.PP
On some systems (those supporting both \fIgetrusage()\fR with the \s-1POSIX\s0
threads) there can also be \f(CW\*(C`RUSAGE_THREAD\*(C'\fR. The BSD::Resource supports
the \f(CW\*(C`RUSAGE_THREAD\*(C'\fR if it is present but understands nothing more about
the \s-1POSIX\s0 threads themselves.  Similarly for \f(CW\*(C`RUSAGE_BOTH\*(C'\fR: some systems
support retrieving the sums of the self and child resource consumptions
simultaneously.
.PP
In list context \fIgetrusage()\fR returns the current resource usages as a
list. On failure it returns an empty list.

\&\f(CW\*(C`RLIM_INFINITY\*(C'\fR is useful in \fIsetrlimit()\fR, the \f(CW\*(C`RLIM_INFINITY\*(C'\fR is
often represented as minus one (\-1).
.PP
In list context \f(CW\*(C`getrlimit()\*(C'\fR returns the current soft and hard
resource limits as a list.  On failure it returns an empty list.
.PP
Processes have soft and hard resource limits.  On crossing the soft
limit they receive a signal (for example the \f(CW\*(C`SIGXCPU\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`SIGXFSZ\*(C'\fR,
corresponding to the \f(CW\*(C`RLIMIT_CPU\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`RLIMIT_FSIZE\*(C'\fR, respectively).
The processes can trap and handle some of these signals, please see

ruthlessly killed by the \f(CW\*(C`KILL\*(C'\fR signal which cannot be caught.

group, 0 signifying the current one.
.PP
Usual values for \f(CW\*(C`PRIO_MIN\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`PRIO_MAX\*(C'\fR, are \-20, 20.  A negative

real hard limits are normally buried inside the kernel and are \fBvery\fR
system-dependent.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1NOTE\s0\fR: Even the soft limit that is actually set might be lower than
what requested for various reasons.  One possibility is that the
actual limit on a resource might be controlled by some system variable
(e.g. in \s-1BSD\s0 systems the \s-1RLIMIT_NPROC\s0 can be capped by the system
variable \f(CW\*(C`maxprocperuid\*(C'\fR, try \f(CW\*(C`sysctl \-a kern.maxprocperuid\*(C'\fR),
or in many environments core dumping has been disabled from normal
user processes.  Another possibility is that a limit is rounded down
to some alignment or granularity, for example the memory limits might
be rounded down to the closest 4 kilobyte boundary.  In other words,
do not expect to be able to \fIsetrlimit()\fR a limit to a value and then be
able to read back the same value with \fIgetrlimit()\fR.

In \fB\s-1AIX\s0\fR (at least version 3, maybe later also releases) if the \s-1BSD\s0
compatibility library is not installed or not found by the BSD::Resource
installation procedure and when using the \fIgetpriority()\fR or \fIsetpriority()\fR,
the \f(CW\*(C`PRIO_MIN\*(C'\fR is 0 (corresponding to \-20) and \f(CW\*(C`PRIO_MAX\*(C'\fR is 39
(corresponding to 19, the \s-1BSD\s0 priority 20 is unreachable).
.PP
In \fBHP-UX\fR the \fIgetrusage()\fR is not Officially Supported at all but for
the time being, it does seem to be.
.PP
In \fBMac \s-1OS X\s0\fR a normal user cannot raise the \f(CW\*(C`RLIM_NPROC\*(C'\fR over the
maxprocperuid limit (the default value is 266, try the command
\&\f(CW\*(C`sysctl \-a kern.maxprocperuid\*(C'\fR).
.PP
In \fBNetBSD\fR \f(CW\*(C`RLIMIT_STACK\*(C'\fR \fIsetrlimit()\fR calls fail.

In \fBCygwin\fR \f(CW\*(C`RLIMIT_STACK\*(C'\fR setrlimit calls fail.  Also, \fIsetrlimit()\fR
\&\f(CW\*(C`RLIMIT_NOFILE/RLIMIT_OFILE/RLIMIT_OFILE\*(C'\fR calls return success, but
then the subsequent getrlimit calls show that the limits didn't really
change.
.PP
Because not all \s-1UNIX\s0 kernels are \s-1BSD\s0 and also because of the sloppy
support of \fIgetrusage()\fR by many vendors many of the \fIgetrusage()\fR values
may not be correctly updated.  For example \fBSolaris 1\fR claims in
\&\f(CW\*(C`<sys/rusage.h>\*(C'\fR that the \f(CW\*(C`ixrss\*(C'\fR and the \f(CW\*(C`isrss\*(C'\fR fields
are always zero.  In \fBSunOS 5.5 and 5.6\fR the \fIgetrusage()\fR leaves most
of the fields zero and therefore \fIgetrusage()\fR is not even used, instead
of that the \fB/proc\fR interface is used.  The mapping is not perfect:
the \f(CW\*(C`maxrss\*(C'\fR field is really the \fBcurrent\fR resident size instead of the
maximum, the \f(CW\*(C`idrss\*(C'\fR is really the \fBcurrent\fR heap size instead of the
integral data, and the \f(CW\*(C`isrss\*(C'\fR is really the \fBcurrent\fR stack size
instead of the integral stack.  The ixrss has no sensible counterpart
at all so it stays zero.

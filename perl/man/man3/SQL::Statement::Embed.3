.SH "NAME"
SQL::Statement::Embed \- embed a SQL engine in a DBD or module
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
SQL::Statement is designed to be easy to embed in other modules and to be
especially easy to embed in \s-1DBI\s0 drivers.  It provides a \s-1SQL\s0 Engine and the
other module needs to then provide a data source and a storage mechanism.
For example, the \s-1DBD::CSV\s0 module uses SQL::Statement as an embedded \s-1SQL\s0
engine by implementing a file-based data source and by using \s-1DBI\s0 as the
user interface.  Similarly DBD::Amazon uses SQL::Statement as its \s-1SQL\s0
engine, provides its own extensions to the supported \s-1SQL\s0 syntax, and uses
on-the-fly searches of Amazon.com as its data source.
.PP
SQL::Statement is the basis for at least eight existing DBDs (\s-1DBI\s0 database
drivers).  If you have a new data source, you too can create a \s-1DBD\s0 without
having to reinvent the \s-1SQL\s0 wheel.  It is fun and easy so become a \s-1DBD\s0
author today!
.PP
SQL::Statement can be also be embedded without \s-1DBI. \s0 We will explore that
first since developing a \s-1DBD\s0 uses most of the same methods and techniques.
.SH "The role of SQL::Statement subclasses"
.IX Header "The role of SQL::Statement subclasses"
SQL::Statement provides a \s-1SQL\s0 parsing and execution engine.  It neither
provides a data source nor storage mechanism other than in-memory tables.
The DBI::DBD::SqlEngine contains a subclass of SQL::Statement to
abstract from embedding SQL::Statement into a \s-1DBD\s0 and lets you concentrate
on the extensions you need to make. DBD::File extends DBI::DBD::SqlEngine
by providing access to file-based storage mechanisms.  It is quite possible
to use things other than files as data sources, in which case you would not
use DBD::File, instead you would replace DBD::File's methods with your
own.  In the examples below, we use DBD::File, replacing only a few
methods.
.PP
SQL::Statement provides \s-1SQL\s0 parsing and evaluation and DBI::DBD::SqlEngine
provides \s-1DBI\s0 integration.  The only thing missing is a data source \- what we
actually want to store and query.   As an example suppose we are going to
create a subclass called 'Foo' that will provide as a data source the
in-memory storage which is used in \s-1SQL::RAM\s0 to provide the \f(CW\*(C`TEMP\*(C'\fR
tables in SQL::Statement, but the rows are stored as a string using a
serializer (Storable).
.PP
Consider what needs to happen to perform a \s-1SELECT\s0 query on our 'Foo' data:
.PP
.Vb 8
\& * receive a SQL string
\& * parse the SQL string into a request structure
\& * open the table(s) specified in the request
\& * define column names and positions for the table
\& * read rows from the table
\& * convert the rows from colon\-separated format into perl arrays
\& * match the columns and rows against the requested selection criteria
\& * return requested rows and columns to the user
.Ve
.PP
To perform operations like \s-1INSERT\s0 and \s-1DELETE,\s0 we also need to:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& * convert rows from perl arrays into colon\-separated format
\& * write rows
\& * delete rows
.Ve
.PP
SQL::Statement takes care of all of the \s-1SQL\s0 parsing and evaluation.
DBD::File takes care of file opening, reading, writing, and deleting.
So the only things 'Foo' is really responsible for are:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& * define column names and positions for the table
\& * convert rows from colon\-separated format into perl arrays
\& * convert rows from perl arrays into colon\-separated format
.Ve
.PP
In SQL::Statement subclasses these responsibilities are assigned to two
objects.  A ::Statement object is responsible for opening the table by
creating new ::Table objects.  A ::Table object is responsible for
defining the column names and positions, opening data sources, reading,
converting, writing and deleting data.
.PP
The real work is therefore done in the ::Table object, the ::Statement
subclass is required to deliver the right ::Table object.
.SH "Creating a ::Statement object"
.IX Header "Creating a ::Statement object"
A subclass of SQL::Statement must provide at least one method called
\&\fIopen_table()\fR.  The method should open a new Table object and define the
table's columns.  For our 'Foo' module, here is the complete object
definition:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    package Foo;
\&
\&    package Foo::Statement;
\&    use DBD::File;
\&    use base qw(DBI::DBD::SqlEngine::Statement);
\&
\&    sub open_table {
\&        my ($self, $sth, $table, $createMode, $lockMode) = @_;
\&
\&        my $class = ref $self;
\&        $class =~ s/::Statement/::Table/;
\&
\&        return $class\->new ($sth, $table, $createMode, $lockMode);
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Since 'Foo' is an in-memory data source, we subclass SQL::Statement
indirectly through DBD::File::Statement.  The \fIopen_table()\fR method lets
DBD::File do the actual table opening.  All we do is define the files
directory (f_dir), the names of the columns (col_names) and the positions
of the columns (col_nums).  DBD::File creates and returns a \f(CW$tbl\fR object.
It names that object according to the module that calls it, so in our
case the object will be a Foo::Table object.
.SH "Creating a ::Table object"
.IX Header "Creating a ::Table object"
Table objects are responsible for reading, converting, writing, and
deleting data. Since DBD::File provides most of those services, our 'Foo'
subclass only needs to define three methods \- \fIfetch_row()\fR to read data,
\&\fIpush_row()\fR to write data, and \fIpush_names()\fR to store column names.  We will
leave deleting to DBD::File, since deleting a record in the 'Foo' format
is the same process as deleting a record in any other simple file-based
format.  Here is the complete object definition:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& package Foo::Table;
\& use base qw(DBD::File::Table);
\&
\& sub fetch_row {
\&    my($self, $data) = @_;
\&    my $fieldstr = $self\->{fh}\->getline;
\&    return undef unless $fieldstr;
\&    chomp $fieldstr;
\&    my @fields   = split /:/,$fieldstr;
\&    $self\->{row} = (@fields ? \e@fields : undef);
\& }
\& sub push_row {
\&    my($self, $data, $fields) = @_;
\&    my $str = join \*(Aq:\*(Aq, map { defined $_ ? $_ : \*(Aq\*(Aq } @$fields;
\&    $self\->{fh}\->print( $str."\en");
\&    1;
\& }
\& sub push_names {}
\& 1;
.Ve
.PP
The \fIfetch_row()\fR method uses DBD::File's \fIgetline()\fR method to physically
read a row of data, then we convert it from native colon-separated format
into a perl arrayref.
.PP
The \fIpush_row()\fR method converts from a perl arrayref back to colon-separated
format then uses DBD::File's \fIprint()\fR method to print it to file.
.PP
The push_names method does nothing because it's purpose is to store column
names in a file and in our 'Foo' subclass, we are defining the column names
ourselves, not storing them in a file.
.SH "Trying out our new subclass"
.IX Header "Trying out our new subclass"
Here is a script which should create and query a file in our 'Foo' format.
It assumes you have saved the Foo, Foo::Statement, and Foo::Table classes
shown above into a file called Foo.pm.
.PP
.Vb 10
\& #!perl \-w
\& use strict;
\& use Foo;
\& my $parser = SQL::Parser\->new();
\& $parser\->{RaiseError}=1;
\& $parser\->{PrintError}=0;
\& for my $sql(split /\en/,
\& "  DROP TABLE IF EXISTS group_id
\&    CREATE TABLE group_id (username CHAR,uid INT, gid INT)
\&    INSERT INTO group_id VALUES(\*(Aqjoe\*(Aq,1,1)
\&    INSERT INTO group_id VALUES(\*(Aqsue\*(Aq,2,1)
\&    INSERT INTO group_id VALUES(\*(Aqbob\*(Aq,3,2)
\&    SELECT * FROM group_id             "
\& ){
\&    my $stmt = Foo::Statement\->new($sql,$parser);
\&    $stmt\->execute;
\&    next unless $stmt\->command eq \*(AqSELECT\*(Aq;
\&    while (my $row=$stmt\->fetch) {
\&        print "@$row\en";
\&    }
\& }
.Ve
.PP
This is the same script as shown in the section on executing and fetching
in SQL::Statement::Structure except that instead of
SQL::Statement\->\fInew()\fR, we are using Foo::Statement\->\fInew()\fR.   The other
difference is that the execute/fetch example was using in-memory storage
while this script is using file-based storage and the 'Foo' format we
defined.  When you run this script, you will be creating a file called
\&\*(L"group_id\*(R" and it will contain the specified data in colon-separated
format.

.IX Subsection "Moving from a subclass to a DBD"
A \s-1DBD\s0 based on SQL::Statement uses the same two subclasses that are shown
above.  They should be called DBD::Foo::Statement and DBD::Foo::Table, but
would otherwise be identical to the non-DBD subclass illustrated above.
To turn it into a full \s-1DBD,\s0 you have to subclass DBD::File, DBD::File::dr,
DBD::File::db, and DBD::File::st.  In many cases a simple subclass with
few or no methods overridden is sufficient.

.SH "Expanding the DBD"
.IX Header "Expanding the DBD"
Now that we have a basic \s-1DBD\s0 operational, there are several directions for
expansion.  In the first place, we might want to override some or all of
DBD::File::Table to provide alternate means of reading, writing, and
deleting from our data source.  We might want to override the \fIopen_table()\fR
method to provide a different means of identifying column names (e.g.
reading them from the file itself) or to provide other kinds of metadata.
See SQL::Eval for documentation of the \s-1API\s0 for ::Table objects and see
DBD::File for an example subclass.
.PP
We might want to create extensions to the \s-1SQL\s0 syntax specific to our \s-1DBD.\s0
See the section on extending \s-1SQL\s0 syntax in SQL::Statement::Syntax.
.PP
We might want to provide a completely different kind of data source.  See
\&\s-1DBD::DBM\s0 (whose source code includes documentation on subclassing
SQL::Statement and DBD::File), and other DBD::File subclasses such as
\&\s-1DBD::CSV\s0.
.PP
We might also want to provide a completely different storage mechanism,
something not based on files at all.  See DBD::Amazon and
DBD::AnyData.
.PP
And we will almost certainly want to fine-tune the \s-1DBI\s0 interface, see
\&\s-1DBI::DBD\s0.
.SH "Getting help with a new DBD"

The dbi\-devATperl.org mailing list should be your first stop in creating a

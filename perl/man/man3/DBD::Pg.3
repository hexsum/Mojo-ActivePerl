DBD::Pg is a Perl module that works with the \s-1DBI\s0 module to provide access to
PostgreSQL databases.
.SH "MODULE DOCUMENTATION"

This documentation describes driver specific behavior and restrictions. It is
not supposed to be used as the only reference for the user. In any case
consult the \fB\s-1DBI\s0\fR documentation first!

.IX Subsection "connect"
.PP
This method creates a database handle by connecting to a database, and is the \s-1DBI \s0
equivalent of the \*(L"new\*(R" method. To connect to a Postgres database with a minimum of parameters, 
use the following syntax:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect("dbi:Pg:dbname=$dbname", \*(Aq\*(Aq, \*(Aq\*(Aq, {AutoCommit => 0});
.Ve
.PP
This connects to the database named in the \f(CW$dbname\fR variable on the default port (usually 5432) 
without any user authentication.
.PP
The following connect statement shows almost all possible parameters:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect("dbi:Pg:dbname=$dbname;host=$host;port=$port;options=$options",
\&                      $username,
\&                      $password,
\&                      {AutoCommit => 0, RaiseError => 1, PrintError => 0}
\&                     );
.Ve
.PP
If a parameter is not given, the \fIconnect()\fR method will first look for 
specific environment variables, and then fall back to hard-coded defaults:
.PP
.Vb 11
\&  parameter    environment variable    hard coded default
\&  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\&  host         PGHOST                  local domain socket
\&  hostaddr     PGHOSTADDR              local domain socket
\&  port         PGPORT                  5432
\&  dbname*      PGDATABASE              current userid
\&  username     PGUSER                  current userid
\&  password     PGPASSWORD              (none)
\&  options      PGOPTIONS               (none)
\&  service      PGSERVICE               (none)
\&  sslmode      PGSSLMODE               (none)
.Ve
.PP
* May also use the aliases \f(CW\*(C`db\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`database\*(C'\fR
.PP
If the username and password values passed via \f(CW\*(C`connect()\*(C'\fR are undefined (as opposed 
to merely being empty strings), \s-1DBI\s0 will use the environment variables \fI\s-1DBI_USER\s0\fR 
and \fI\s-1DBI_PASS\s0\fR if they exist.
.PP
You can also connect by using a service connection file, which is named 
\&\fIpg_service.conf\fR. The location of this file can be controlled by 
setting the \fI\s-1PGSYSCONFDIR\s0\fR environment variable. To use one of the named 
services within the file, set the name by using either the \fIservice\fR parameter 
or the environment variable \fI\s-1PGSERVICE\s0\fR. Note that when connecting this way, 
only the minimum parameters should be used. For example, to connect to a 
service named \*(L"zephyr\*(R", you could use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect("dbi:Pg:service=zephyr", \*(Aq\*(Aq, \*(Aq\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
You could also set \f(CW$ENV{PGSERVICE}\fR to \*(L"zephyr\*(R" and connect like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect("dbi:Pg:", \*(Aq\*(Aq, \*(Aq\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
The format of the \fIpg_service.conf\fR file is simply a bracketed service 
name, followed by one parameter per line in the format name=value.
For example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  [zephyr]
\&  dbname=winds
\&  user=wisp
\&  password=W$2Hc00YSgP
\&  port=6543
.Ve
.PP
There are four valid arguments to the \fIsslmode\fR parameter, which controls 
whether to use \s-1SSL\s0 to connect to the database:
.IP "\(bu" 4
disable: \s-1SSL\s0 connections are never used
.IP "\(bu" 4
allow: try non-SSL, then \s-1SSL\s0
.IP "\(bu" 4
prefer: try \s-1SSL,\s0 then non-SSL
.IP "\(bu" 4
require: connect only with \s-1SSL\s0
.PP
You can also connect using sockets in a specific directory. This 
may be needed if the server you are connecting to has a different 
default socket directory from the one used to compile DBD::Pg. 
Use the complete path to the socket directory as the name of the 
host, like this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect(\*(Aqdbi:Pg:dbname=foo;host=/var/tmp/socket\*(Aq,
\&    $username,
\&    $password,
\&    {AutoCommit => 0, RaiseError => 1});
.Ve
.PP
The attribute hash can also contain a key named \f(CW\*(C`dbd_verbose\*(C'\fR, which 
simply calls \f(CW\*(C`$dbh\->trace(\*(AqDBD\*(Aq)\*(C'\fR after the handle is created. This attribute 
is not recommended, as it is clearer to simply explicitly call \f(CW\*(C`trace\*(C'\fR explicitly 
in your script.

.Vb 2
\&  @data_sources = DBI\->data_sources(\*(AqPg\*(Aq);

.Ve
.PP
Returns a list of available databases. Unless the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`DBI_DSN\*(C'\fR is set, 
a connection will be attempted to the database \f(CW\*(C`template1\*(C'\fR. The normal connection 
environment variables also apply, such as \f(CW\*(C`PGHOST\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`PGPORT\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`DBI_USER\*(C'\fR, 
\&\f(CW\*(C`DBI_PASS\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`PGSERVICE\*(C'\fR.
.PP
You can also pass in options to add to the connection string For example, to specify 
an alternate port and host:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  @data_sources = DBI\->data_sources(\*(AqPg\*(Aq, \*(Aqport=5824;host=example.com\*(Aq);
\&
\&  or:
\&
\&  @data_sources = $dbh\->data_sources(\*(Aqport=5824;host=example.com\*(Aq);

.SS "Methods Common To All Handles"
.IX Subsection "Methods Common To All Handles"
For all of the methods below, \fB\f(CB$h\fB\fR can be either a database handle (\fB\f(CB$dbh\fB\fR) 
or a statement handle (\fB\f(CB$sth\fB\fR). Note that \fI\f(CI$dbh\fI\fR and \fI\f(CI$sth\fI\fR can be replaced with 
any variable name you choose: these are just the names most often used. Another 
common variable used in this documentation is $\fIrv\fR, which stands for \*(L"return value\*(R".
.PP
\fI\f(BIerr\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "err"
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $rv = $h\->err;
.Ve
.PP
Returns the error code from the last method called. For the connect method it returns
\&\f(CW\*(C`PQstatus\*(C'\fR, which is a number used by \fIlibpq\fR (the Postgres connection library). A value of 0 
indicates no error (\s-1CONNECTION_OK\s0), while any other number indicates a failed connection. The 
only other number commonly seen is 1 (\s-1CONNECTION_BAD\s0). See the libpq documentation for the 
complete list of return codes.
.PP
In all other non-connect methods \f(CW\*(C`$h\->err\*(C'\fR returns the \f(CW\*(C`PQresultStatus\*(C'\fR of the current
handle. This is a number used by libpq and is one of:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&  0  Empty query string
\&  1  A command that returns no data successfully completed.
\&  2  A command that returns data successfully completed.
\&  3  A COPY OUT command is still in progress.
\&  4  A COPY IN command is still in progress.
\&  5  A bad response was received from the backend.
\&  6  A nonfatal error occurred (a notice or warning message)
\&  7  A fatal error was returned: the last query failed.
.Ve
.PP
\fI\f(BIerrstr\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "errstr"
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $str = $h\->errstr;
.Ve
.PP
Returns the last error that was reported by Postgres. This message is affected 
by the pg_errorlevel setting.
.PP
\fI\f(BIstate\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "state"
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $str = $h\->state;
.Ve
.PP
Returns a five-character \*(L"\s-1SQLSTATE\*(R"\s0 code. Success is indicated by a \f(CW00000\fR code, which 
gets mapped to an empty string by \s-1DBI. A\s0 code of \f(CW\*(C`S8006\*(C'\fR indicates a connection failure, 
usually because the connection to the Postgres server has been lost.
.PP
While this method can be called as either \f(CW\*(C`$sth\->state\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`$dbh\->state\*(C'\fR, it 
is usually clearer to always use \f(CW\*(C`$dbh\->state\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The list of codes used by PostgreSQL can be found at:
<http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/errcodes\-appendix.html>
.PP
Note that these codes are part of the \s-1SQL\s0 standard and only a small number 
of them will be used by PostgreSQL.
.PP
Common codes:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  00000 Successful completion
\&  25P01 No active SQL transaction
\&  25P02 In failed SQL transaction
\&  S8006 Connection failure

.Vb 3
\&  $h\->trace($trace_settings);
\&  $h\->trace($trace_settings, $trace_filename);
\&  $trace_settings = $h\->trace;
.Ve
.PP
Changes the trace settings on a database or statement handle. 
The optional second argument specifies a file to write the 
trace information to. If no filename is given, the information 
is written to \fI\s-1STDERR\s0\fR. Note that tracing can be set globally as 
well by setting \f(CW\*(C`DBI\->trace\*(C'\fR, or by using the environment 
variable \fI\s-1DBI_TRACE\s0\fR.
.PP
The value is either a numeric level or a named flag. For the 
flags that DBD::Pg uses, see parse_trace_flag.
.PP
\fI\f(BItrace_msg\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "trace_msg"
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $h\->trace_msg($message_text);
\&  $h\->trace_msg($message_text, $min_level);
.Ve
.PP
Writes a message to the current trace output (as set by the \*(L"trace\*(R" method). If a second argument 
is given, the message is only written if the current tracing level is equal to or greater than 
the \f(CW$min_level\fR.
.PP
\fI\f(BIparse_trace_flag\fI and \f(BIparse_trace_flags\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "parse_trace_flag and parse_trace_flags"
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $h\->trace($h\->parse_trace_flags(\*(AqSQL|pglibpq\*(Aq));
\&  $h\->trace($h\->parse_trace_flags(\*(Aq1|pgstart\*(Aq));
\&
\&  ## Simpler:
\&  $h\->trace(\*(AqSQL|pglibpq\*(Aq);
\&  $h\->trace(\*(Aq1|pgstart\*(Aq);
\&
\&  my $value = DBD::Pg\->parse_trace_flag(\*(Aqpglibpq\*(Aq);
\&  DBI\->trace($value);
.Ve
.PP
The parse_trace_flags method is used to convert one or more named 
flags to a number which can passed to the \*(L"trace\*(R" method.
DBD::Pg currently supports the DBI-specific flag, \f(CW\*(C`SQL\*(C'\fR, 
as well as the ones listed below.
.PP
Flags can be combined by using the parse_trace_flags method, 
which simply calls \f(CW\*(C`parse_trace_flag\*(C'\fR on each item and 
combines them.
.PP
Sometimes you may wish to turn the tracing on before you connect 
to the database. The second example above shows a way of doing this: 
the call to \f(CW\*(C`DBD::Pg\->parse_trace_flags\*(C'\fR provides a number than can 
be fed to \f(CW\*(C`DBI\->trace\*(C'\fR before you create a database handle.
.PP
DBD::Pg supports the following trace flags:
.IP "\s-1SQL\s0" 4
.IX Item "SQL"
Outputs all \s-1SQL\s0 statements. Note that the output provided will not 
necessarily be in a form suitable to passing directly to Postgres, 
as server-side prepared statements are used extensively by DBD::Pg.
For maximum portability of output (but with a potential performance 
hit), use with \f(CW\*(C`$dbh\->{pg_server_prepare} = 0\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\s-1DBD\s0" 4
.IX Item "DBD"
Turns on all non-DBI flags, in other words, only the ones that are specific 
to DBD::Pg (all those below which start with the letters 'pg').
.IP "pglibpq" 4
.IX Item "pglibpq"
Outputs the name of each libpq function (without arguments) immediately 
before running it. This is a good way to trace the flow of your program 
at a low level. This information is also output if the trace level 
is set to 4 or greater.
.IP "pgstart" 4
.IX Item "pgstart"
Outputs the name of each internal DBD::Pg function, and other information such as 
the function arguments or important global variables, as each function starts. This 
information is also output if the trace level is set to 4 or greater.
.IP "pgend" 4
.IX Item "pgend"
Outputs a simple message at the very end of each internal DBD::Pg function. This is also 
output if the trace level is set to 4 or greater.
.IP "pgprefix" 4
.IX Item "pgprefix"
Forces each line of trace output to begin with the string \fB\f(CB\*(C`dbdpg: \*(C'\fB\fR. This helps to 
differentiate it from the normal \s-1DBI\s0 trace output.
.IP "pglogin" 4
.IX Item "pglogin"
Outputs a message showing the connection string right before a new database connection 
is attempted, a message when the connection was successful, and a message right after 
the database has been disconnected. Also output if trace level is 5 or greater.
.PP
\fI\f(BIfunc\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "func"
.PP
DBD::Pg uses the \f(CW\*(C`func\*(C'\fR method to support a variety of functions. 
Note that the name of the function comes \fIlast\fR, after the arguments.
.IP "table_attributes" 4
.IX Item "table_attributes"
.Vb 1
\&  $attrs = $dbh\->func($table, \*(Aqtable_attributes\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
Use of the tables_attributes function is no longer recommended. Instead,
you can use the more portable \f(CW\*(C`column_info\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`primary_key\*(C'\fR methods
to access the same information.
.Sp
The table_attributes method returns, for the given table argument, a
reference to an array of hashes, each of which contains the following keys:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&  NAME        attribute name
\&  TYPE        attribute type
\&  SIZE        attribute size (\-1 for variable size)

.Ve
.IP "pg_lo_creat" 4
.IX Item "pg_lo_creat"
.Vb 1
\&  $lobjId = $dbh\->pg_lo_creat($mode);
.Ve
.Sp
Creates a new large object and returns the object-id. \f(CW$mode\fR is a bitmask
describing read and write access to the new object. This setting is ignored
since Postgres version 8.1. For backwards compatibility, however, you should 
set a valid mode anyway (see \*(L"pg_lo_open\*(R" for a list of valid modes).
.Sp
Upon failure it returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR. This function cannot be used if AutoCommit is enabled.
.Sp
The old way of calling large objects functions is deprecated: \f(CW$dbh\fR\->func(.., 'lo_);
.IP "pg_lo_open" 4
.IX Item "pg_lo_open"
.Vb 1
\&  $lobj_fd = $dbh\->pg_lo_open($lobjId, $mode);
.Ve
.Sp
Opens an existing large object and returns an object-descriptor for use in
subsequent \f(CW\*(C`pg_lo_*\*(C'\fR calls. \f(CW$mode\fR is a bitmask describing read and write
access to the opened object. It may be one of:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  $dbh\->{pg_INV_READ}
\&  $dbh\->{pg_INV_WRITE}
\&  $dbh\->{pg_INV_READ} | $dbh\->{pg_INV_WRITE}
.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`pg_INV_WRITE\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`pg_INV_WRITE | pg_INV_READ\*(C'\fR modes are identical; in
both modes, the large object can be read from or written to.
Reading from the object will provide the object as written in other committed
transactions, along with any writes performed by the current transaction.
Objects opened with \f(CW\*(C`pg_INV_READ\*(C'\fR cannot be written to. Reading from this
object will provide the stored data at the time of the transaction snapshot
which was active when \f(CW\*(C`pg_lo_write\*(C'\fR was called.
.Sp
Returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR upon failure. Note that 0 is a perfectly correct (and common)
object descriptor! This function cannot be used if AutoCommit is enabled.
.IP "pg_lo_write" 4
.IX Item "pg_lo_write"
.Vb 1
\&  $nbytes = $dbh\->pg_lo_write($lobj_fd, $buffer, $len);

.IP "pg_lo_tell" 4
.IX Item "pg_lo_tell"
.Vb 1
\&  $loc = $dbh\->pg_lo_tell($lobj_fd);
.Ve
.Sp
Returns the current read or write location on the large object \f(CW$lobj_fd\fR and \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR upon failure.

If set to true, then the \*(L"disconnect\*(R" method will not be automatically called when 
the database handle goes out of scope. This is required if you are forking, and even 
then you must tread carefully and ensure that either the parent or the child (but not 
both!) handles all database calls from that point forwards, so that messages from the 
Postgres backend are only handled by one of the processes. If you don't set things up 
properly, you will see messages such as "\fIserver closed the connection unexpectedly\fR\*(L", 
and \*(R"\fImessage type 0x32 arrived from server while idle\fR". The best solution is to either 
have the child process reconnect to the database with a fresh database handle, or to 
rewrite your application not to use forking. See the section on \*(L"Asynchronous Queries\*(R"

.PP
\&\s-1WARNING:\s0 DBD::Pg now (as of version 1.40) uses true prepared statements by sending them 
to the backend to be prepared by the Postgres server. Statements 
that were legal before may no longer work. See below for details.
.PP
The prepare method prepares a statement for later execution. PostgreSQL supports 
prepared statements, which enables DBD::Pg to only send the query once, and
simply send the arguments for every subsequent call to \*(L"execute\*(R".
DBD::Pg can use these server-side prepared statements, or it can
just send the entire query to the server each time. The best way
is automatically chosen for each query. This will be sufficient for
most users: keep reading for a more detailed explanation and some
optional flags.
.PP
Queries that do not begin with the word \*(L"\s-1SELECT\*(R", \*(L"INSERT\*(R", 
\&\*(L"UPDATE\*(R",\s0 or \*(L"\s-1DELETE\*(R"\s0 are never sent as server-side prepared statements.
.PP
Deciding whether or not to use prepared statements depends on many factors, 
but you can force them to be used or not used by using the 
pg_server_prepare attribute when calling \*(L"prepare\*(R". Setting this to \*(L"0\*(R" means to never use 
prepared statements. Setting pg_server_prepare to \*(L"1\*(R" means that prepared 
statements should be used whenever possible. This is the default when connected 
to Postgres servers version 8.0 or higher. Servers that are version 7.4 get a special 
default value of \*(L"2\*(R", because server-side statements were only partially supported 
in that version. In this case, it only uses server-side prepares if all 
parameters are specifically bound.
.PP
The pg_server_prepare attribute can also be set at connection time like so:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  $dbh = DBI\->connect($DBNAME, $DBUSER, $DBPASS,
\&                      { AutoCommit => 0,
\&                        RaiseError => 1,
\&                        pg_server_prepare => 0,
\&                      });
.Ve
.PP
or you may set it after your database handle is created:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh\->{pg_server_prepare} = 1;
.Ve
.PP
To enable it for just one particular statement:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $sth = $dbh\->prepare("SELECT id FROM mytable WHERE val = ?",
\&                       { pg_server_prepare => 1 });
.Ve
.PP
You can even toggle between the two as you go:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  $sth\->{pg_server_prepare} = 1;
\&  $sth\->execute(22);
\&  $sth\->{pg_server_prepare} = 0;
\&  $sth\->execute(44);
\&  $sth\->{pg_server_prepare} = 1;
\&  $sth\->execute(66);
.Ve
.PP
In the above example, the first execute will use the previously prepared statement.
The second execute will not, but will build the query into a single string and send
it to the server. The third one will act like the first and only send the arguments.
Even if you toggle back and forth, a statement is only prepared once.
.PP
Using prepared statements is in theory quite a bit faster: not only does the
PostgreSQL backend only have to prepare the query only once, but DBD::Pg no
longer has to worry about quoting each value before sending it to the server.
.PP
However, there are some drawbacks. The server cannot always choose the ideal
parse plan because it will not know the arguments before hand. But for most
situations in which you will be executing similar data many times, the default
plan will probably work out well. Programs such as PgBouncer which cache connections 
at a low level should not use prepared statements via DBD::Pg, or must take 
extra care in the application to account for the fact that prepared statements 
are not shared across database connections. Further discussion on this subject is beyond
the scope of this documentation: please consult the pgsql-performance mailing
list, <http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql\-performance/>
.PP
Only certain commands will be sent to a server-side prepare: currently these
include \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`INSERT\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`UPDATE\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`DELETE\*(C'\fR. DBD::Pg uses a simple
naming scheme for the prepared statements themselves: \fBdbdpg_XY_Z\fR, where \fBY\fR is the current 
\&\s-1PID, \s0\fBX\fR is either 'p' or 'n' (depending on if the \s-1PID\s0 is a positive or negative 
number), and \fBZ\fR is a number that starts at 1 and increases each time a new statement 
is prepared. This number is tracked at the database handle level, so multiple
statement handles will not collide.
.PP
You cannot send more than one command at a time in the same prepare command 
(by separating them with semi-colons) when using server-side prepares.
.PP
The actual \f(CW\*(C`PREPARE\*(C'\fR is usually not performed until the first execute is called, due
to the fact that information on the data types (provided by \*(L"bind_param\*(R") may
be provided after the prepare but before the execute.
.PP
A server-side prepare may happen before the first \*(L"execute\*(R", but only if the server can
handle the server-side prepare, and the statement contains no placeholders. It will 
also be prepared if the pg_prepare_now attribute is passed in and set to a true 
value. Similarly, the pg_prepare_now attribute can be set to 0 to ensure that
the statement is \fBnot\fR prepared immediately, although the cases in which you would
want this are very rare. Finally, you can set the default behavior of all prepare
statements by setting the pg_prepare_now attribute on the database handle:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh\->{pg_prepare_now} = 1;
.Ve
.PP
The following two examples will be prepared right away:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $sth\->prepare("SELECT 123"); ## no placeholders
\&
\&  $sth\->prepare("SELECT 123, ?", {pg_prepare_now => 1});
.Ve
.PP
The following two examples will \s-1NOT\s0 be prepared right away:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $sth\->prepare("SELECT 123, ?"); ## has a placeholder
\&
\&  $sth\->prepare("SELECT 123", {pg_prepare_now => 0});
.Ve
.PP
There are times when you may want to prepare a statement yourself. To do this,
simply send the \f(CW\*(C`PREPARE\*(C'\fR statement directly to the server (e.g. with
the \*(L"do\*(R" method). Create a statement handle and set the prepared name via
the pg_prepare_name attribute. The statement handle can be created with a dummy
statement, as it will not be executed. However, it should have the same
number of placeholders as your prepared statement. Example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  $dbh\->do(\*(AqPREPARE mystat AS SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_class WHERE reltuples < ?\*(Aq);
\&  $sth = $dbh\->prepare(\*(AqSELECT ?\*(Aq);
\&  $sth\->bind_param(1, 1, SQL_INTEGER);
\&  $sth\->{pg_prepare_name} = \*(Aqmystat\*(Aq;
\&  $sth\->execute(123);
.Ve
.PP
The above will run the equivalent of this query on the backend:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  EXECUTE mystat(123);
.Ve
.PP
which is the equivalent of:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_class WHERE reltuples < 123;
.Ve
.PP
You can force DBD::Pg to send your query directly to the server by adding
the pg_direct attribute to your prepare call. This is not recommended,
but is added just in case you need it.
.PP
\fBPlaceholders\fR
.IX Subsection "Placeholders"
.PP
There are three types of placeholders that can be used in DBD::Pg. The first is
the \*(L"question mark\*(R" type, in which each placeholder is represented by a single
question mark character. This is the method recommended by the \s-1DBI\s0 specs and is the most
portable. Each question mark is internally replaced by a \*(L"dollar sign number\*(R" in the order
in which they appear in the query (important when using \*(L"bind_param\*(R").
.PP
The second type of placeholder is \*(L"dollar sign numbers\*(R". This is the method
that Postgres uses internally and is overall probably the best method to use
if you do not need compatibility with other database systems. DBD::Pg, like
PostgreSQL, allows the same number to be used more than once in the query.
Numbers must start with \*(L"1\*(R" and increment by one value (but can appear in any order 
within the query). If the same number appears more than once in a query, it is treated as a 
single parameter and all instances are replaced at once. Examples:
.PP
Not legal:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $SQL = \*(AqSELECT count(*) FROM pg_class WHERE relpages > $2\*(Aq; # Does not start with 1
\&
\&  $SQL = \*(AqSELECT count(*) FROM pg_class WHERE relpages BETWEEN $1 AND $3\*(Aq; # Missing 2
.Ve
.PP
Legal:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $SQL = \*(AqSELECT count(*) FROM pg_class WHERE relpages > $1\*(Aq;
\&
\&  $SQL = \*(AqSELECT count(*) FROM pg_class WHERE relpages BETWEEN $1 AND $2\*(Aq;
\&
\&  $SQL = \*(AqSELECT count(*) FROM pg_class WHERE relpages BETWEEN $2 AND $1\*(Aq; # legal but confusing
\&
\&  $SQL = \*(AqSELECT count(*) FROM pg_class WHERE relpages BETWEEN $1 AND $2 AND reltuples > $1\*(Aq;
\&
\&  $SQL = \*(AqSELECT count(*) FROM pg_class WHERE relpages > $1 AND reltuples > $1\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
In the final statement above, \s-1DBI\s0 thinks there is only one placeholder, so this
statement will replace both placeholders:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $sth\->bind_param(1, 2045);
.Ve
.PP
While a simple execute with no bind_param calls requires only a single argument as well:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $sth\->execute(2045);
.Ve
.PP
The final placeholder type is \*(L"named parameters\*(R" in the format \*(L":foo\*(R". While this
syntax is supported by DBD::Pg, its use is discouraged in favor of 
dollar-sign numbers.
.PP
The different types of placeholders cannot be mixed within a statement, but you may
use different ones for each statement handle you have. This is confusing at best, so 
stick to one style within your program.
.PP
If your queries use operators that contain question marks (e.g. some of the native 
Postgres geometric operators and \s-1JSON\s0 operators) or array slices (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`data[100:300]\*(C'\fR), 
there are methods to instruct DBD::Pg to not treat some symbols as placeholders. First, you 
may simply add a backslash before the start of a placeholder, and DBD::Pg will strip the 
backslash and not treat the character as a placeholder.
.PP
You can also tell DBD::Pg to ignore any non-dollar sign placeholders by setting the 
pg_placeholder_dollaronly attribute at either the database handle or the statement 
handle level. Examples:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  $dbh\->{pg_placeholder_dollaronly} = 1;
\&  $sth = $dbh\->prepare(q{SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE lseg1 ?# lseg2 AND name = $1});
\&  $sth\->execute(\*(Aqsegname\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
Alternatively, you can set it at prepare time:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  $sth = $dbh\->prepare(q{SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE lseg1 ?\-| lseg2 AND name = $1},
\&    {pg_placeholder_dollaronly => 1});
\&  $sth\->execute(\*(Aqsegname\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
If your queries use array slices but you still want to use question marks as
placeholders, you can tell DBD::Pg to ignore just colon placeholders by setting
the \*(L"pg_placeholder_nocolons\*(R" attribute in the same way. Examples:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  $dbh\->{pg_placeholder_nocolons} = 1;
\&  $sth = $dbh\->prepare(q{SELECT array[1:2] FROM mytable WHERE id = ?});
\&  $sth\->execute(1);
.Ve
.PP
Again, you may set it param time as well:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  $sth = $dbh\->prepare(q{SELECT array[1:2] FROM mytable WHERE id = ?}.
\&    {pg_placeholder_nocolons => 1});
\&  $sth\->execute(1);

.PP
Prepare and execute a single statement. Returns the number of rows affected if the 
query was successful, returns undef if an error occurred, and returns \-1 if the 
number of rows is unknown or not available. Note that this method will return \fB0E0\fR instead
of 0 for 'no rows were affected', in order to always return a true value if no error occurred.
.PP
If neither \f(CW\*(C`\e%attr\*(C'\fR nor \f(CW@bind_values\fR is given, the query will be sent directly
to the server without the overhead of internally creating a statement handle and
running prepare and execute, for a measurable speed increase.
.PP
Note that an empty statement (a string with no length) will not be passed to
the server; if you want a simple test, use \*(L"\s-1SELECT 123\*(R"\s0 or the \*(L"ping\*(R" method.

.Ve
.PP
Attempts to return the id of the last value to be inserted into a table.
You can either provide a sequence name (preferred) or provide a table
name with optional schema, and DBD::Pg will attempt to find the sequence itself. 
The current value of the sequence is returned by a call to the \f(CW\*(C`CURRVAL()\*(C'\fR 
PostgreSQL function. This will fail if the sequence has not yet been used in the 
current database connection.
.PP
If you do not know the name of the sequence, you can provide a table name and
DBD::Pg will attempt to return the correct value. To do this, there must be at
least one column in the table with a \f(CW\*(C`NOT NULL\*(C'\fR constraint, that has a unique
constraint, and which uses a sequence as a default value. If more than one column
meets these conditions, the primary key will be used. This involves some
looking up of things in the system table, so DBD::Pg will cache the sequence
name for subsequent calls. If you need to disable this caching for some reason,
(such as the sequence name changing), you can control it by adding \f(CW\*(C`pg_cache => 0\*(C'\fR
to the final (hashref) argument for last_insert_id.
.PP
Please keep in mind that this method is far from foolproof, so make your
script use it properly. Specifically, make sure that it is called
immediately after the insert, and that the insert does not add a value
to the column that is using the sequence as a default value. However, because 
we are using sequences, you can be sure that the value you got back has not 
been used by any other process.

Issues a \s-1COMMIT\s0 to the server, indicating that the current transaction is finished and that 
all changes made will be visible to other processes. If AutoCommit is enabled, then 
a warning is given and no \s-1COMMIT\s0 is issued. Returns true on success, false on error.

.PP
\fI\f(BIrollback\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "rollback"
.PP
.Vb 1

.Ve
.PP
Issues a \s-1ROLLBACK\s0 to the server, which discards any changes made in the current transaction. If AutoCommit 
is enabled, then a warning is given and no \s-1ROLLBACK\s0 is issued. Returns true on success, and 
false on error. See also the the section on \*(L"Transactions\*(R".
.PP
\fI\f(BIbegin_work\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "begin_work"
.PP
This method turns on transactions until the next call to \*(L"commit\*(R" or \*(L"rollback\*(R", if AutoCommit is 
currently enabled. If it is not enabled, calling begin_work will issue an error. Note that the 
transaction will not actually begin until the first statement after begin_work is called.
Example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  $dbh\->{AutoCommit} = 1;
\&  $dbh\->do(\*(AqINSERT INTO foo VALUES (123)\*(Aq); ## Changes committed immediately
\&  $dbh\->begin_work();
\&  ## Not in a transaction yet, but AutoCommit is set to 0
\&
\&  $dbh\->do("INSERT INTO foo VALUES (345)");
\&  ## DBD::PG actually issues two statements here:
\&  ## BEGIN;
\&  ## INSERT INTO foo VALUES (345)
\&  ## We are now in a transaction
\&

\&  ## AutoCommit is now set to 1 again
.Ve
.PP
\fI\f(BIdisconnect\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "disconnect"
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $rv = $dbh\->disconnect;
.Ve
.PP
Disconnects from the Postgres database. Any uncommitted changes will be rolled back upon disconnection. It's 
good policy to always explicitly call commit or rollback at some point before disconnecting, rather than 
relying on the default rollback behavior.
.PP
This method may give warnings about \*(L"disconnect invalidates X active statement handle(s)\*(R". This means that 
you called \f(CW\*(C`$sth\->execute()\*(C'\fR but did not finish fetching all the rows from them. To avoid seeing this 
warning, either fetch all the rows or call \f(CW\*(C`$sth\->finish()\*(C'\fR for each executed statement handle.
.PP
If the script exits before disconnect is called (or, more precisely, if the database handle is no longer 
referenced by anything), then the database handle's \s-1DESTROY\s0 method will call the \fIrollback()\fR and \fIdisconnect()\fR 
methods automatically. It is best to explicitly disconnect rather than rely on this behavior.
.PP
\fI\f(BIquote\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "quote"
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $rv = $dbh\->quote($value, $data_type);
.Ve
.PP
This module implements its own \f(CW\*(C`quote\*(C'\fR method. For simple string types, both backslashes 
and single quotes are doubled. You may also quote arrayrefs and receive a string 
suitable for passing into Postgres array columns.
.PP
If the value contains backslashes, and the server is version 8.1 or higher, 
then the escaped string syntax will be used (which places a capital E before 
the first single quote). This syntax is always used when quoting bytea values 
on servers 8.1 and higher.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`data_type\*(C'\fR argument is optional and should be one of the type constants 
exported by DBD::Pg (such as \s-1PG_BYTEA\s0). In addition to string, bytea, char, bool, 
and other standard types, the following geometric types are supported: point, line, 
lseg, box, path, polygon, and circle (\s-1PG_POINT, PG_LINE, PG_LSEG, PG_BOX, 
PG_PATH, PG_POLYGON,\s0 and \s-1PG_CIRCLE\s0 respectively). To quote a Postgres-specific 
data type, you must use a 'hashref' argument like so:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  my $quotedval = $dbh\->quote($value, { pg_type => PG_VARCHAR });
.Ve
.PP
\&\fB\s-1NOTE:\s0\fR The undocumented (and invalid) support for the \f(CW\*(C`SQL_BINARY\*(C'\fR data
type is officially deprecated. Use \f(CW\*(C`PG_BYTEA\*(C'\fR with \f(CW\*(C`bind_param()\*(C'\fR instead:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $rv = $sth\->bind_param($param_num, $bind_value,

.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $string = $dbh\->quote_identifier( $name );
\&  $string = $dbh\->quote_identifier( undef, $schema, $table);
.Ve
.PP
Returns a quoted version of the supplied string, which is commonly a schema, 
table, or column name. The three argument form will return the schema and 
the table together, separated by a dot. Examples:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  print $dbh\->quote_identifier(\*(Aqgrapefruit\*(Aq); ## Prints: "grapefruit"
\&
\&  print $dbh\->quote_identifier(\*(Aqjuicy fruit\*(Aq); ## Prints: "juicy fruit"

\fI\f(BIpg_notifies\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "pg_notifies"
.PP

Looks for any asynchronous notifications received and returns either \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR 
or a reference to a three-element array consisting of an event name, the \s-1PID \s0
of the backend that sent the \s-1NOTIFY\s0 command, and the optional payload string. 
Note that this does not check if the connection to the database is still valid first \- 
for that, use the c<ping> method. You may need to commit if not in autocommit mode \- 
new notices will not be picked up while in the middle of a transaction. An example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $dbh\->do("LISTEN abc");
\&  $dbh\->do("LISTEN def");
\&
\&  ## Hang around until we get the message we want
\&  LISTENLOOP: {
\&    while (my $notify = $dbh\->pg_notifies) {
\&      my ($name, $pid, $payload) = @$notify;
\&      print qq{I received notice "$name" from PID $pid, payload was "$payload"\en};
\&      ## Do something based on the notice received
\&    }
\&    $dbh\->ping() or die qq{Ping failed!};
\&    $dbh\->commit();
\&    sleep(5);
\&    redo;

Payloads will always be an empty string unless you are connecting to a Postgres 
server version 9.0 or higher.

.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $rv = $dbh\->ping;
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`ping\*(C'\fR method determines if there is a working connection to an active 
database server. It does this by sending a small query to the server, currently 
\&\fB'DBD::Pg ping test v3.5.3'\fR. It returns 0 (false) if the connection is not valid, 
otherwise it returns a positive number (true). The value returned indicates the 
current state:
.PP

\&  Value    Meaning
\&  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

This is a DBD::Pg\-specific extension to the \*(L"ping\*(R" method. This will check the 
validity of a database handle in exactly the same way as \f(CW\*(C`ping\*(C'\fR, but instead of 
returning a 0 for an invalid connection, it will return a negative number. So in 
addition to returning the positive numbers documented for \f(CW\*(C`ping\*(C'\fR, it may also 
return the following:

Returns all tables and views visible to the current user.  The schema and table
arguments will do a \f(CW\*(C`LIKE\*(C'\fR search if a percent sign (\f(CW\*(C`%\*(C'\fR) or an underscore
(\f(CW\*(C`_\*(C'\fR) is detected in the argument. The \f(CW$type\fR argument accepts any

.PP
Note that a statement handle is returned, and not a direct list of tables. See
the examples below for ways to handle this.
.PP
The following fields are returned:
.PP
\&\fB\s-1TABLE_CAT\s0\fR: Always \s-1NULL,\s0 as Postgres does not have the concept of catalogs.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1TABLE_SCHEM\s0\fR: The name of the schema that the table or view is in.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1TABLE_NAME\s0\fR: The name of the table or view.

.PP
The \s-1TABLE_SCHEM\s0 and \s-1TABLE_NAME\s0 will be quoted via \f(CW\*(C`quote_ident()\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Two additional fields specific to DBD::Pg are returned:
.PP
\&\fBpg_schema\fR: the unquoted name of the schema
.PP
\&\fBpg_table\fR: the unquoted name of the table
.PP
If your database supports tablespaces (version 8.0 or greater), two additional
DBD::Pg specific fields are returned:
.PP
\&\fBpg_tablespace_name\fR: the name of the tablespace the table is in
.PP
\&\fBpg_tablespace_location\fR: the location of the tablespace the table is in
.PP
Tables that have not been assigned to a particular tablespace (or views)
will return \s-1NULL \s0(\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR) for both of the above field.
.PP
Rows are returned alphabetically, with all tables first, and then all views.

.Ve
.PP
Supported by this driver as proposed by \s-1DBI.\s0 There are no search patterns allowed, but leaving the 
\&\f(CW$schema\fR argument blank will cause the first table found in the schema 
search path to be used. An additional field, \*(L"\s-1DATA_TYPE\*(R",\s0 is returned and 
shows the data type for each of the arguments in the \*(L"\s-1COLUMN_NAME\*(R"\s0 field.
.PP
This method will also return tablespace information for servers that support
tablespaces. See the \*(L"table_info\*(R" entry for more information.
.PP
The five additional custom fields returned are:
.PP
\&\fBpg_tablespace_name\fR: name of the tablespace, if any
.PP
\&\fBpg_tablespace_location\fR: location of the tablespace
.PP
\&\fBpg_schema\fR: the unquoted name of the schema
.PP
\&\fBpg_table\fR: the unquoted name of the table
.PP
\&\fBpg_column\fR: the unquoted name of the column
.PP
In addition to the standard format of returning one row for each column
found for the primary key, you can pass the \f(CW\*(C`pg_onerow\*(C'\fR attribute to force
a single row to be used. If the primary key has multiple columns, the
\&\*(L"\s-1KEY_SEQ\*(R", \*(L"COLUMN_NAME\*(R",\s0 and \*(L"\s-1DATA_TYPE\*(R"\s0 fields will return a comma-delimited
string. If the \f(CW\*(C`pg_onerow\*(C'\fR attribute is set to \*(L"2\*(R", the fields will be
returned as an arrayref, which can be useful when multiple columns are
involved:
.PP
.Vb 8

used. Two additional fields, \*(L"\s-1UK_DATA_TYPE\*(R"\s0 and \*(L"\s-1FK_DATA_TYPE\*(R",\s0 are returned
to show the data type for the unique and foreign key columns. Foreign
keys that have no named constraint (where the referenced column only has
an unique index) will return \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR for the \*(L"\s-1UK_NAME\*(R"\s0 field.

Returns a statement handle that can be fetched from to give statistics information 
on a specific table and its indexes. The \f(CW$table\fR argument is mandatory. The 
\&\f(CW$schema\fR argument is optional but recommended. The \f(CW$unique_only\fR argument, if true,

see the \s-1DBI\s0 documentation.
.PP
In addition, the following Postgres specific columns are returned:
.IP "pg_expression" 4
.IX Item "pg_expression"
Postgres allows indexes on functions and scalar expressions based on one or more columns. This field

.PP
Supported by DBD::Pg as proposed by \s-1DBI.\s0 According to the classification of
\&\s-1DBI,\s0 PostgreSQL is a database in which a transaction must be explicitly
started. Without starting a transaction, every change to the database becomes
immediately permanent. The default of AutoCommit is on, but this may change
in the future, so it is highly recommended that you explicitly set it when
calling \*(L"connect\*(R". For details see the notes about \*(L"Transactions\*(R"

Specifies if the current database connection should be in read-only mode or not. 
In this mode, changes that change the database are not allowed and will throw 
an error. Note: this method will \fBnot\fR work if \*(L"AutoCommit\*(R" is true. The 
read-only effect is accomplished by sending a SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY after 
every begin. For more details, please see:
.PP
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/sql\-set\-transaction.html
.PP
Please not that this method is not foolproof: there are still ways to update the 
database. Consider this a safety net to catch applications that should not be 
issuing commands such as \s-1INSERT, UPDATE,\s0 or \s-1DELETE.\s0

\fI\f(BIpg_server_prepare\fI (integer)\fR
.IX Subsection "pg_server_prepare (integer)"
.PP
DBD::Pg specific attribute. Indicates if DBD::Pg should attempt to use server-side

be used whenever possible. See the section on the \*(L"prepare\*(R" method for more information.
.PP
\fI\f(BIpg_switch_prepared\fI (integer)\fR
.IX Subsection "pg_switch_prepared (integer)"
.PP
DBD::Pg specific attribute. Indicates when DBD::Pg will internally switch from using 
PQexecParams to PQexecPrepared. In other words, when it will start using server-side 
prepared statements (assuming all other requirements for them are met). The default value, 
2, means that a prepared statement will be prepared and used the second and subsequent 
time execute is called. To always use PQexecPrepared instead of PQexecParams, set 
pg_switch_prepared to 1 (this was the default behavior in earlier versions). 
Setting pg_switch_prepared to 0 will force DBD::Pg to always use PQexecParams.
.PP
\fI\f(BIpg_placeholder_dollaronly\fI (boolean)\fR

DBD::Pg specific attribute. Defaults to false. When true, question marks inside of statements 
are not treated as placeholders. Useful for statements that contain unquoted question 
marks, such as geometric operators. Note that you may also simply escape question marks with 
a backslash to prevent them from being treated as placeholders.
.PP
\fI\f(BIpg_placeholder_nocolons\fI (boolean)\fR

being treated as a placeholder.
.PP
\fI\f(BIpg_enable_utf8\fI (integer)\fR
.IX Subsection "pg_enable_utf8 (integer)"
.PP
DBD::Pg specific attribute. The behavior of DBD::Pg with regards to this flag has 
changed as of version 3.0.0. The default value for this attribute, \-1, indicates 
that the internal Perl \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR flag will be turned on for all strings coming back 
from the database if the client_encoding is set to '\s-1UTF8\s0'. Use of this default 
is highly encouraged. If your code was previously using pg_enable_utf8, you can 
probably remove mention of it entirely.
.PP
If this attribute is set to 0, then the internal \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR flag will *never* be 
turned on for returned data, regardless of the current client_encoding.
.PP
If this attribute is set to 1, then the internal \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR flag will *always* 
be turned on for returned data, regardless of the current client_encoding 
(with the exception of bytea data).
.PP
Note that the value of client_encoding is only checked on connection time. If 
you change the client_encoding to/from '\s-1UTF8\s0' after connecting, you can set 
pg_enable_utf8 to \-1 to force DBD::Pg to read in the new client_encoding and 
act accordingly.
.PP
\fI\f(BIpg_errorlevel\fI (integer)\fR
.IX Subsection "pg_errorlevel (integer)"
.PP
DBD::Pg specific attribute. Sets the amount of information returned by the server's 
error messages. Valid entries are 0, 1, and 2. Any other number will be forced to the 
default value of 1.
.PP
A value of 0 (\*(L"\s-1TERSE\*(R"\s0) will show severity, primary text, and position only
and will usually fit on a single line. A value of 1 (\*(L"\s-1DEFAULT\*(R"\s0) will also

Allows the user to bind a value and/or a data type to a placeholder. This is
especially important when using server-side prepares. See the 
\&\*(L"prepare\*(R" method for more information.
.PP
The value of \f(CW$param_num\fR is a number if using the '?' or '$1' style
placeholders. If using \*(L":foo\*(R" style placeholders, the complete name
(e.g. \*(L":foo\*(R") must be given. For numeric values, you can either use a
number or use a literal '$1'. See the examples below.
.PP
The \f(CW$bind_value\fR argument is fairly self-explanatory. A value of \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR will
bind a \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR to the placeholder. Using \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is useful when you want
to change just the type and will be overwriting the value later.
(Any value is actually usable, but \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is easy and efficient).
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`\e%attr\*(C'\fR hash is used to indicate the data type of the placeholder.
The default value is \*(L"varchar\*(R". If you need something else, you must
use one of the values provided by \s-1DBI\s0 or by DBD::Pg. To use a \s-1SQL\s0 value,
modify your \*(L"use \s-1DBI\*(R"\s0 statement at the top of your script as follows:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use DBI qw(:sql_types);
.Ve
.PP
This will import some constants into your script. You can plug those
directly into the \*(L"bind_param\*(R" call. Some common ones that you will

.Ve
.PP

Data types are \*(L"sticky,\*(R" in that once a data type is set to a certain placeholder,
it will remain for that placeholder, unless it is explicitly set to something
else afterwards. If the statement has already been prepared, and you switch the
data type to something else, DBD::Pg will re-prepare the statement for you before
doing the next execute.

\&  $rv = $sth\->bind_param_inout($param_num, \e$scalar, 0);
.Ve
.PP
Experimental support for this feature is provided. The first argument to 
bind_param_inout should be a placeholder number. The second argument 
should be a reference to a scalar variable in your script. The third argument 
is not used and should simply be set to 0. Note that what this really does is 
assign a returned column to the variable, in the order in which the column 
appears. For example:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  my $foo = 123;
\&  $sth = $dbh\->prepare("SELECT 1+?::int");
\&  $sth\->bind_param_inout(1, \e$foo, 0);
\&  $foo = 222;
\&  $sth\->execute(444);
\&  $sth\->fetch;
.Ve
.PP
The above will cause \f(CW$foo\fR to have a new value of \*(L"223\*(R" after the final fetch.
Note that the variables bound in this manner are very sticky, and will trump any 
values passed in to execute. This is because the binding is done as late as possible, 
at the \fIexecute()\fR stage, allowing the value to be changed between the time it was bound 
and the time the query is executed. Thus, the above execute is the same as:

much more information.
.PP
Setting one of the bind_values to \*(L"undef\*(R" is the equivalent of setting the value 
to \s-1NULL\s0 in the database. Setting the bind_value to \f(CW$DBDPG_DEFAULT\fR is equivalent 
to sending the literal string '\s-1DEFAULT\s0' to the backend. Note that using this 
option will force server-side prepares off until such time as PostgreSQL 
supports using \s-1DEFAULT\s0 in prepared statements.

DBD::Pg also supports passing in arrays to execute: simply pass in an arrayref, 
and DBD::Pg will flatten it into a string suitable for input on the backend.

.PP
Fetches the next row of data from the statement handle, and returns a reference to an array 
holding the column values. Any columns that are \s-1NULL\s0 are returned as undef within the array.
.PP
If there are no more rows or if an error occurs, the this method return undef. You should 
check \f(CW\*(C`$sth\->err\*(C'\fR afterwards (or use the RaiseError attribute) to discover if the undef returned 
was due to an error.
.PP
Note that the same array reference is returned for each fetch, so don't store the reference and 
then use it after a later fetch. Also, the elements of the array are also reused for each row, 
so take care if you want to take a reference to an element. See also \*(L"bind_columns\*(R".

.PP
Fetches the next row of data and returns a hashref containing the name of the columns as the keys 
and the data itself as the values. Any \s-1NULL\s0 value is returned as an undef value.
.PP
If there are no more rows or if an error occurs, the this method return undef. You should 
check \f(CW\*(C`$sth\->err\*(C'\fR afterwards (or use the RaiseError attribute) to discover if the undef returned

The optional \f(CW$name\fR argument should be either \f(CW\*(C`NAME\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`NAME_lc\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`NAME_uc\*(C'\fR, and indicates

.Ve
.PP
Returns a reference to an array of arrays that contains all the remaining rows to be fetched from the 
statement handle. If there are no more rows, an empty arrayref will be returned. If an error occurs, 
the data read in so far will be returned. Because of this, you should always check \f(CW\*(C`$sth\->err\*(C'\fR after 
calling this method, unless RaiseError has been enabled.
.PP
If \f(CW$slice\fR is an array reference, fetchall_arrayref uses the \*(L"fetchrow_arrayref\*(R" method to fetch each 
row as an array ref. If the \f(CW$slice\fR array is not empty then it is used as a slice to select individual 
columns by perl array index number (starting at 0, unlike column and parameter numbers which start at 1).
.PP
With no parameters, or if \f(CW$slice\fR is undefined, fetchall_arrayref acts as if passed an empty array ref.
.PP
If \f(CW$slice\fR is a hash reference, fetchall_arrayref uses \*(L"fetchrow_hashref\*(R" to fetch each row as a hash reference.

the number of rows is available immediately after calling \f(CW\*(C`$sth\->execute\*(C'\fR. Note that

.Ve
.PP
Fetches all the rows from the statement handle, calls \f(CW\*(C`DBI::neat_list\*(C'\fR for each row, and 
prints the results to \f(CW$fh\fR (which defaults to \fI\s-1STDOUT\s0\fR). Rows are separated by \f(CW$lsep\fR (which defaults 
to a newline). Columns are separated by \f(CW$fsep\fR (which defaults to a comma). The \f(CW$maxlen\fR controls 
how wide the output can be, and defaults to 35.
.PP
This method is designed as a handy utility for prototyping and testing queries. Since it uses 
\&\*(L"neat_list\*(R" to format and edit the string for reading by humans, it is not recommended 
for data transfer applications.

.PP
Supported by DBD::Pg. This method is implemented by \s-1DBI\s0 but not
currently documented by \s-1DBI,\s0 so this method might change.
.PP
This method seems to be heavily influenced by the current implementation of
blobs in Oracle. Nevertheless we try to be as compatible as possible. Whereas
Oracle suffers from the limitation that blobs are related to tables and every
table can have only one blob (datatype \s-1LONG\s0), PostgreSQL handles its blobs
independent of any table by using so-called object identifiers. This explains
why the \f(CW\*(C`blob_read\*(C'\fR method is blessed into the \s-1STATEMENT\s0 package and not part of
the \s-1DATABASE\s0 package. Here the field parameter has been used to handle this
object identifier. The offset and len parameters may be set to zero, in which
case the whole blob is fetched at once.
.PP
See also the PostgreSQL-specific functions concerning blobs, which are
available via the \f(CW\*(C`func\*(C'\fR interface.
.PP

DBD::Pg specific attribute. Indicates when DBD::Pg will internally switch from using 
PQexecParams to PQexecPrepared. In other words, when it will start using server-side 
prepared statements (assuming all other requirements for them are met). The default value, 
2, means that a prepared statement will be prepared and used the second and subsequent 
time execute is called. To always use PQexecPrepared instead of PQexecParams, set 
pg_switch_prepared to 1 (this was the default behavior in earlier versions). 
Setting pg_switch_prepared to 0 will force DBD::Pg to always use PQexecParams.

DBD::Pg has extensive support for a client_encoding of \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 and most 
things like encoding and decoding should happen automatically. If you are 
using a different encoding, you will need do the encoding and decoding 
yourself. For this reason, it is highly recommended to always use a 
client_encoding of \s-1UTF\-8.\s0 The server_encoding can be anything, and no 
recommendations are made there, other than avoid \s-1SQL_ASCII\s0 whenever 
possible.

.PP
According to the \s-1DBI\s0 specification the default for \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR is a true

.SS "Savepoints"
.IX Subsection "Savepoints"
PostgreSQL version 8.0 introduced the concept of savepoints, which allows 
transactions to be rolled back to a certain point without affecting the 
rest of the transaction. DBD::Pg encourages using the following methods to 
control savepoints:
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`pg_savepoint\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "pg_savepoint"
.PP
Creates a savepoint. This will fail unless you are inside of a transaction. The 
only argument is the name of the savepoint. Note that PostgreSQL \s-1DOES\s0 allow 
multiple savepoints with the same name to exist.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh\->pg_savepoint("mysavepoint");
.Ve
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`pg_rollback_to\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "pg_rollback_to"
.PP
Rolls the database back to a named savepoint, discarding any work performed after 
that point. If more than one savepoint with that name exists, rolls back to the 
most recently created one.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh\->pg_rollback_to("mysavepoint");
.Ve
.PP
\fI\f(CI\*(C`pg_release\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "pg_release"
.PP
Releases (or removes) a named savepoint. If more than one savepoint with that name 
exists, it will only destroy the most recently created one. Note that all savepoints 
created after the one being released are also destroyed.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh\->pg_release("mysavepoint");

.SS "Asynchronous Queries"
.IX Subsection "Asynchronous Queries"
It is possible to send a query to the backend and have your script do other work while the query is 
running on the backend. Both queries sent by the \*(L"do\*(R" method, and by the \*(L"execute\*(R" method can be 
sent asynchronously. (\s-1NOTE:\s0 This will only work if DBD::Pg has been compiled against Postgres libraries 
of version 8.0 or greater) The basic usage is as follows:
.PP
.Vb 1

\&
\&  print "Async do() example:\en";
\&  $dbh\->do("SELECT long_running_query()", {pg_async => PG_ASYNC});

You may also use the numbers instead of the constants, but using the constants is recommended as it 
makes your script more readable.
.IP "\s-1PG_ASYNC\s0" 4
.IX Item "PG_ASYNC"
This is a constant for the number 1. It is passed to either the \*(L"do\*(R" or the \*(L"prepare\*(R" method as a value 
to the pg_async key and indicates that the query should be sent asynchronously.
.IP "\s-1PG_OLDQUERY_CANCEL\s0" 4
.IX Item "PG_OLDQUERY_CANCEL"
This is a constant for the number 2. When passed to either the \*(L"do\*(R" or the \*(L"prepare\*(R" method, it causes any 
currently running asynchronous query to be cancelled and rolled back. It has no effect if no asynchronous 
query is currently running.
.IP "\s-1PG_OLDQUERY_WAIT\s0" 4
.IX Item "PG_OLDQUERY_WAIT"
This is a constant for the number 4. When passed to either the \*(L"do\*(R" or the \*(L"prepare\*(R" method, it waits for any 
currently running asynchronous query to complete. It has no effect if there is no asynchronous query currently running.

.IP "\fBpg_cancel\fR" 4
.IX Item "pg_cancel"
This database-level method attempts to cancel any currently running asynchronous query. It returns true if 
the cancel succeeded, and false otherwise. Note that a query that has finished before this method is executed 
will also return false. \fB\s-1WARNING\s0\fR: a successful cancellation may leave the database in an unusable state, 
so you may need to \s-1ROLLBACK\s0 or \s-1ROLLBACK TO\s0 a savepoint. As of version 2.17.0 of DBD::Pg, rollbacks are 
not done automatically.
.Sp
.Vb 1

.Ve
.IP "\fBpg_ready\fR" 4
.IX Item "pg_ready"
This method can be called as a database handle method or (for convenience) as a statement handle method. Both simply 
see if a previously issued asynchronous query has completed yet. It returns true if the statement has finished, in which 
case you should then call the \*(L"pg_result\*(R" method. Calls to \f(CW\*(C`pg_ready()\*(C'\fR should only be used when you have other 
things to do while the query is running. If you simply want to wait until the query is done, do not call \fIpg_ready()\fR
over and over, but simply call the \fIpg_result()\fR method.
.Sp

.IP "\fBpg_result\fR" 4
.IX Item "pg_result"
This database handle method returns the results of a previously issued asynchronous query. If the query is still 
running, this method will wait until it has finished. The result returned is the number of rows: the same thing 
that would have been returned by the asynchronous \*(L"do\*(R" or \*(L"execute\*(R" if it had been called without an asynchronous flag.

\fIAsynchronous Examples\fR
.IX Subsection "Asynchronous Examples"
.PP
Here are some working examples of asynchronous queries. Note that we'll use the \fBpg_sleep\fR function to emulate a 
long-running query.
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  use strict;
\&  use warnings;
\&  use Time::HiRes \*(Aqsleep\*(Aq;
\&  use DBD::Pg \*(Aq:async\*(Aq;
\&
\&  my $dbh = DBI\->connect(\*(Aqdbi:Pg:dbname=postgres\*(Aq, \*(Aqpostgres\*(Aq, \*(Aq\*(Aq, {AutoCommit=>0,RaiseError=>1});
\&
\&  ## Kick off a long running query on the first database:
\&  my $sth = $dbh\->prepare("SELECT pg_sleep(?)", {pg_async => PG_ASYNC});
\&  $sth\->execute(5);
\&
\&  ## While that is running, do some other things
\&  print "Your query is processing. Thanks for waiting\en";
\&  check_on_the_kids(); ## Expensive sub, takes at least three seconds.
\&
\&  while (!$dbh\->pg_ready) {
\&    check_on_the_kids();
\&    ## If the above function returns quickly for some reason, we add a small sleep
\&    sleep 0.1;
\&  }
\&
\&  print "The query has finished. Gathering results\en";
\&  my $result = $sth\->pg_result;
\&  print "Result: $result\en";
\&  my $info = $sth\->fetchall_arrayref();
.Ve
.PP
Without asynchronous queries, the above script would take about 8 seconds to run: five seconds waiting 
for the execute to finish, then three for the \fIcheck_on_the_kids()\fR function to return. With asynchronous 
queries, the script takes about 6 seconds to run, and gets in two iterations of check_on_the_kids in 
the process.
.PP
Here's an example showing the ability to cancel a long-running query. Imagine two slave databases in 
different geographic locations over a slow network. You need information as quickly as possible, so 
you query both at once. When you get an answer, you tell the other one to stop working on your query, 
as you don't need it anymore.

.SS "Array support"
.IX Subsection "Array support"
DBD::Pg allows arrays (as arrayrefs) to be passed in to both 
the \*(L"quote\*(R" and the \*(L"execute\*(R" methods. In both cases, the array is 
flattened into a string representing a Postgres array.
.PP
When fetching rows from a table that contains a column with an 
array type, the result will be passed back to your script as an arrayref.
.PP
To turn off the automatic parsing of returned arrays into arrayrefs, 
you can set the attribute pg_expand_array, which is true by default.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh\->{pg_expand_array} = 0;
.Ve
.SS "\s-1COPY\s0 support"
.IX Subsection "COPY support"
DBD::Pg allows for quick (bulk) reading and storing of data by using 
the \fB\s-1COPY\s0\fR command. The basic process is to use \f(CW\*(C`$dbh\->do\*(C'\fR to issue a 
\&\s-1COPY\s0 command, and then to either add rows using \*(L"pg_putcopydata\*(R", or to 
read them by using \*(L"pg_getcopydata\*(R".
.PP
The first step is to put the server into \*(L"\s-1COPY\*(R"\s0 mode. This is done by 
sending a complete \s-1COPY\s0 command to the server, by using the \*(L"do\*(R" method. 
For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh\->do("COPY foobar FROM STDIN");
.Ve
.PP
This would tell the server to enter a \s-1COPY IN\s0 mode (yes, that's confusing, but 
the \fImode\fR is \s-1COPY IN\s0 because of the \fIcommand\fR \s-1COPY FROM\s0). It is now ready to 
receive information via the \*(L"pg_putcopydata\*(R" method. The complete syntax of the 
\&\s-1COPY\s0 command is more complex and not documented here: the canonical 
PostgreSQL documentation for \s-1COPY\s0 can be found at:
.PP
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql\-copy.html
.PP
Once a \s-1COPY\s0 command has been issued, no other \s-1SQL\s0 commands are allowed 
until \*(L"pg_putcopyend\*(R" has been issued (for \s-1COPY FROM\s0), or the final 
\&\*(L"pg_getcopydata\*(R" has been called (for \s-1COPY TO\s0).
.PP
Note: All other \s-1COPY\s0 methods (pg_putline, pg_getline, etc.) are now 
heavily deprecated in favor of the pg_getcopydata, pg_putcopydata, and 
pg_putcopyend methods.
.PP
\fI\f(BIpg_getcopydata\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "pg_getcopydata"
.PP
Used to retrieve data from a table after the server has been put into a 
\&\s-1COPY OUT\s0 mode by calling \*(L"\s-1COPY\s0 tablename \s-1TO STDOUT\*(R".\s0 Data is always returned 
one data row at a time. The first argument to pg_getcopydata 
is the variable into which the data will be stored (this variable should not 
be undefined, or it may throw a warning, although it may be a reference). The 
pg_getcopydata method returns a number greater than 1 indicating the new size of 
the variable, or a \-1 when the \s-1COPY\s0 has finished. Once a \-1 has been returned, no 
other action is necessary, as \s-1COPY\s0 mode will have already terminated. Example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  $dbh\->do("COPY mytable TO STDOUT");
\&  my @data;
\&  my $x=0;
\&  1 while $dbh\->pg_getcopydata($data[$x++]) >= 0;
.Ve
.PP
There is also a variation of this method called \fBpg_getcopydata_async\fR, which, 
as the name suggests, returns immediately. The only difference from the original 
method is that this version may return a 0, indicating that the row is not 
ready to be delivered yet. When this happens, the variable has not been changed, 
and you will need to call the method again until you get a non-zero result.
(Data is still always returned one data row at a time.)
.PP
\fI\f(BIpg_putcopydata\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "pg_putcopydata"
.PP
Used to put data into a table after the server has been put into \s-1COPY IN\s0 mode 
by calling \*(L"\s-1COPY\s0 tablename \s-1FROM STDIN\*(R".\s0 The only argument is the data you want 
inserted. Issue a \fIpg_putcopyend()\fR when you have added all your rows.
.PP
The default delimiter is a tab character, but this can be changed in 
the \s-1COPY\s0 statement. Returns a 1 on successful input. Examples:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  ## Simple example:
\&  $dbh\->do("COPY mytable FROM STDIN");
\&  $dbh\->pg_putcopydata("123\etPepperoni\et3\en");
\&  $dbh\->pg_putcopydata("314\etMushroom\et8\en");
\&  $dbh\->pg_putcopydata("6\etAnchovies\et100\en");
\&  $dbh\->pg_putcopyend();
\&
\&  ## This example uses explicit columns and a custom delimiter
\&  $dbh\->do("COPY mytable(flavor, slices) FROM STDIN WITH DELIMITER \*(Aq~\*(Aq");
\&  $dbh\->pg_putcopydata("Pepperoni~123\en");
\&  $dbh\->pg_putcopydata("Mushroom~314\en");
\&  $dbh\->pg_putcopydata("Anchovies~6\en");
\&  $dbh\->pg_putcopyend();
.Ve
.PP
\fI\f(BIpg_putcopyend\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "pg_putcopyend"
.PP
When you are finished with pg_putcopydata, call pg_putcopyend to let the server know 
that you are done, and it will return to a normal, non-COPY state. Returns a 1 on 
success. This method will fail if called when not in \s-1COPY IN\s0 mode.
.SS "Large Objects"
.IX Subsection "Large Objects"
DBD::Pg supports all largeobject functions provided by libpq via the
\&\f(CW\*(C`$dbh\->pg_lo*\*(C'\fR methods. Please note that access to a large object, even read-only 
large objects, must be put into a transaction.
.SS "Cursors"
.IX Subsection "Cursors"
Although PostgreSQL supports cursors, they have not been used in the current
implementation. When DBD::Pg was created, cursors in PostgreSQL could only be
used inside a transaction block. Because only one transaction block at a time
is allowed, this would have implied the restriction not to use any nested
\&\f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statements. Therefore the \*(L"execute\*(R" method fetches all data at
once into data structures located in the front-end application. This fact
must to be considered when selecting large amounts of data!
.PP
You can use cursors in your application, but you'll need to do a little
work. First you must declare your cursor. Now you can issue queries against
the cursor, then select against your queries. This typically results in a
double loop, like this:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  # WITH HOLD is not needed if AutoCommit is off
\&  $dbh\->do("DECLARE csr CURSOR WITH HOLD FOR $sql");
\&  while (1) {
\&    my $sth = $dbh\->prepare("fetch 1000 from csr");
\&    $sth\->execute;
\&    last if 0 == $sth\->rows;
\&
\&    while (my $row = $sth\->fetchrow_hashref) {
\&      # Do something with the data.
\&    }
\&  }
\&  $dbh\->do("CLOSE csr");
.Ve
.SS "Datatype bool"
.IX Subsection "Datatype bool"
The current implementation of PostgreSQL returns 't' for true and 'f' for
false. From the Perl point of view, this is a rather unfortunate
choice. DBD::Pg therefore translates the result for the \f(CW\*(C`BOOL\*(C'\fR data type in a
Perlish manner: 'f' becomes the number \f(CW0\fR and 't' becomes the number \f(CW1\fR. This way 
the application does not have to check the database-specific returned values for 
the data-type \f(CW\*(C`BOOL\*(C'\fR because Perl treats \f(CW0\fR as false and \f(CW1\fR as true. You may 
set the pg_bool_tf attribute to a true value to change the values back to 't' and
\&'f' if you wish.
.PP
Boolean values can be passed to PostgreSQL as \s-1TRUE, \s0't', 'true', 'y', 'yes' or
\&'1' for true and \s-1FALSE, \s0'f', 'false', 'n', 'no' or '0' for false.
.SS "Schema support"
.IX Subsection "Schema support"
The PostgreSQL schema concept may differ from those of other databases. In a nutshell,
a schema is a named collection of objects within a single database. Please refer to the
PostgreSQL documentation for more details:
.PP
<http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ddl\-schemas.html>
.PP
DBD::Pg does not provide explicit support for PostgreSQL schemas.
However, schema functionality may be used without any restrictions by
explicitly addressing schema objects, e.g.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  my $res = $dbh\->selectall_arrayref("SELECT * FROM my_schema.my_table");
.Ve
.PP
or by manipulating the schema search path with \f(CW\*(C`SET search_path\*(C'\fR, e.g.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh\->do("SET search_path TO my_schema, public");

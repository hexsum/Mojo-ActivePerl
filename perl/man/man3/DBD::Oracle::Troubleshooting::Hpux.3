Building a working dynamically linked version of the Oracle \s-1DBD\s0 driver
on HP-UX (11.00) has been a challenge for many.  For months after taking
a new job, where HP-UX was the standard database server environment, I
had only been able to build a statically linked version of Perl and the
DBD-Oracle module on HP-UX 11.00.
.PP
Then Roger Foskett posted instructions for what turned out to be dynamic
build.  Rogers's post got me further than I had previously gotten.  In
fact, after resolving some undefined symbol errors, I succeeded where for
I had previously despaired of finding the time to hack out the right
incantation.
.PP
This document describes the combined knowledge of a number of
folks who invested many hours discovering a working set of build options.
The instructions in this file, which include building Perl from source,
will produce a working dynamically linked DBD-Oracle that can be used
with mod_perl and Apache.
.PP
See \s-1APPENDICES\s0 for exact build configurations used by me an others.

The reason you are even reading this file is because you want to connect
to an Oracle database from your perl program using the DBD::Oracle \s-1DBI\s0
driver.  So before you start, install (at least the Oracle client
software) (SQL*Net, Pro*C, SQL*Plus) upon the machine you intend to
install Perl/DBI/DBD\-Oracle.  You \fBdo not\fR, I repeat, \fIdo not\fR need to
build a database on this machine.
.PP
After you have installed the Oracle client software, \fBtest it!\fR. Make
sure you can connect to the target database using SQL*Plus (or any other
Oracle supplied tool).  The (gory) details of the install are beyond the
scope of this document, some information can be found in the section
\&\*(L"Compiling on a Client Machine\*(R", or see your friendly Oracle \s-1DBA.\s0
.PP
One final remark, 3 years after this was first written.  This has been
updated numerous times over the years.  And some of the new build
recipe's see simpler than some of the original instructions in this file.
.PP
I think one reason the recipe is getting simpler may be that the build
hints, in the base perl build have gotten more right, as we have moved
from perl 5.6.1 to the 5.8.8 (now the stable version).
.PP
Someday, if I ever find myself building on \s-1HP\s0 again I should probably
update as many of these recipes (that I can test) by trying to remove
more of the special case stuff I have in my build scripts now.
Gram Ludlows's build for the default bundled C compiler shows that a lot
of this may no longer be necessary.
.PP
On the other hand, it would be bad if we deleted information that others
might need, so I err on the side of too much, in the hope that the
person who really needs the information, will not have to look beyond
this file.

\&\s-1HP\s0's default Perl is no good (and antique).
.PP
By default, HP-UX 11.00 delivered Perl 5.00503 until September 2001.
Others tell me that the default is a threaded GNUpro build of 5.6.1.
This is not what I found on our systems, and it probably depends on which
packages you install.  In any case, this version of Perl delivered by
\&\s-1HP\s0 will in all likelihood not work. Before you check, be sure to prevent
the perl4 located in /usr/contrib/bin from being the first Perl version
found in your \f(CW$PATH\fR.
.PP
As of application release September 2001, HP-UX 11.00 is shipped with
Perl\-5.6.1 in /opt/perl. The first occurrence is on \s-1CD 5012\-7954.\s0 The
build is a portable hppa\-1.1 multithread build that supports large files
compiled with gcc\-2.9\-hppa\-991112. When you have a modern system with a
hppa\-2.0 architecture (PA8xxx processor) and/or the \s-1HP\s0 C\-ANSI-C compiler
consider building your own Perl, which will surely outperform this
version.
.PP
If you are reading this, you have probably discovered that something did
not work.  To get a working version of the DBD-Oracle driver, we have to
start with a Perl that as been built with the correct compiler flags and
shared libraries.  This means that you must build your own version of
Perl from source.
.PP
See \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE FILES\*(R"\s0 for a copy of a makefile used by me to build Perl on
HP-UX and all other platforms on which he works (Sun and Red Hat).
.PP
The instructions below have been used for building a dynamically linked
working DBD-Oracle driver that works with mod_perl and Apache.  These
instructions are based on Perl 5.6.0 and 5.6.1, and 5.8.0.  To this
author's knowledge, they have not be tested on earlier versions of Perl.
.PP
Note that is important to build a \fBnon\fR\-threaded Perl, but linked with
\&\-lcl and \-lpthread.   Since Oracle on \s-1HP\s0 uses libpthread, everything that
dynamically loads it (such as DBD-Oracle) must be built/linked
with '\-lpthread \-lcl'.  (When used with Apache, it and any associated
modules must also be built this way \- otherwise all it does is core
dump when loading DBD::Oracle).
.PP

.PP
One more note, it would appear that the \s-1README\s0.hpux in the Perl 5.8.0
directory, is somewhat out of date, but is up-to-date in versions 5.8.3
and up.  H.Merijn Brand points out that Perl \fIis\fR 64bit compliant when
the \-Duse64bitall flag is used to Configure.  While Perl will be built
in a pure \s-1LP64\s0 environment via the +DD64 flag is used, the +DA2.0w flag
is preferred on PA-RISC, and when an incantation can be concocted that
eliminates the noisy warnings the produces at link time, this will
probably become the default.  Older 64bit versions of \s-1GCC,\s0 are known to
be unable to build a good \s-1LP64\s0 perl. And these flags will cause gcc to
barf. On HP-UX 11i (11.11), gcc\-3.4.4 or gcc\-3.4.5 is preferred over
gcc\-4.0.2 (or older gcc\-4 versions) as 64bit builds on PA-RISC with that
versions of the compiler are unreliable.

While the DBD-Oracle \fIMakefile.PL\fR checks for some of the conditions
which, when met, we know will produce a working build, there are many
variations of Oracle installations and features.  Not all of these can
be tested by any one of us, if you discover a way to make a variation
which did not previously work, please submit patches to the Makefile.PL
to Tim Bunce, and patches to this \s-1README\s0 to me, and I will incorporate
them into the next \s-1README.\s0
.PP
The instructions herein, have compiled, linked cleanly, and tested
cleanly using the \s-1HP\s0 softbench compiler, and Oracle 8.0.5 (32bit), and
Oracle 8.1.6, 8.1.7 (64 bit).  Oracle 8.1.5 will probably work as well.
.PP
Oracle 8.1.7.4 (32bit) with \s-1DBI\-1.35\s0 and DBD\-Oracle\-1.13 has been proven
to work on HP-UX 11.00 (64bit) with Perl 5.6.1, Perl 5.8.x using the
guidelines in this document for both HP-C-ANSI-C and gcc\-3.2. Later
versions have been proven to work as well.  Current \s-1DBI\-1.42\s0 and
DBD\-Oracle\-1.16 have been proven to work.  This Oracle 9.2 client (at
least) should be used if you plan to do work with Unicode.  See the
DBD-Oracle POD/Man documentation.
.SS "gcc Compiler"
.IX Subsection "gcc Compiler"
As of gcc\-3.4, perl\-5.8.3 and up should build out-of-the box when
Configure is invoked with \-Dcc=gcc. Please read \s-1README\s0.hpux carefully
for the differences with \s-1HP\s0 C\-ANSI-C. Once built, tested and installed,
both \s-1DBI\s0 and DBD-Oracle should be able to build against that perl
without trouble.
.PP
In the past, Waldemar Zurowski and Michael Schuh sent useful information
about builds of Perl with DBD-Oracle using gcc on HP-UX.  Both were able
to get working executables, and their explanations shed much light on
the issues.
.PP
Waldemar's build is described in \*(L"Appendix A\*(R", and Michael's is
described in \*(L"Appendix C\*(R".
.PP
While I have not reproduced either of these configurations, I believe
the information is complete enough (particularly in the aggregate) to
be helpful to others who might wish to replicate it.
.PP
If someone would be willing to submit a makefile equivalent to the
makefile in any of the examples from \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLE FILES\*(R"\s0, which uses gcc
to build Perl and the DBI/DBD\-Oracle interfaces, I will be happy to
include it in the next \s-1README.\s0

And now, at long last, we have a recipe for building perl and DBD-Oracle
using the default bundled C compiler.  Please see the \*(L"Appendix B\*(R" build
instructions provided by Gram Ludlow, using the default /usr/bin/cc
bundled compiler. Please note that perl itself will \fI\s-1NOT\s0\fR build using
that compiler.
.SS "Configure (doing it manually)"
.IX Subsection "Configure (doing it manually)"
Once you have downloaded and unpacked the Perl sources (version 5.8.8
assumed here), you must configure Perl.  For those of you new to building
Perl from source, the Configure program will ask you a series of
questions about how to build Perl.  You may supply default answers to the
questions when you invoke the Configure program by command line flags.
.PP
We want to build a Perl that understands large files (over 2GB, wich is
the default for building perl on HP-UX), and that is incompatible with
v5.005 Perl scripts (compiling with v5.005 compatibility causes mod_perl
to complain about malloc pollution).  At the command prompt type:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    cd perl\-5.8.8
\&    sh ./Configure \-A prepend:libswanted=\*(Aqcl pthread \*(Aq \-des
.Ve
.PP
or, if you need a 64bit build
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    sh ./Configure \-A prepend:libswanted=\*(Aqcl pthread \*(Aq \-Duse64bitall \-des
.Ve
.PP
Do not forget the trailing space inside the single quotes. This is also
described by H.Merijn Brand in the \s-1README\s0.hpux from the perl core
distribution.

.Ve

Though this should be the default in more recent perl versions.
.PP
Lastly, and this is optional, when asked:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    Do you want to install Perl as /usr/bin/perl? [y] n
\&
\&    You may or may not want to install directly in /usr/bin/perl,
\&    many persons on HP install Perl in /opt/perl<version>/bin/perl and
\&    put a symbolic link to /usr/bin/perl.  Furthermore, you can supply
\&    the answer to this question by adding an additional switch to the
\&    invocation of Configure such as: Configure \-Dprefix=/opt/perl
.Ve
.PP
After you have answered the above questions, accept the default values
for all of the remaining questions.  You may press <Enter> for each
remaining question, or you may enter \*(L"& \-d\*(R" (good idea) at the next
question and the Configure will go into auto-pilot and use the Perl
supplied defaults.
.PP
\&\s-1BTW:\s0 If you add \-lcl and \-lpthread to the end of the list it will not
work. I wasted a day and a half trying to figure out why I had lost the
recipe, before I realized that this was the problem. The symptom will
be that

of Perl itself will fail to load dynamic libraries.

are correct.  If not, modify config.sh and then re-run ./Configure with
the '\-d' option to process the config.sh file.

It is critical to setup your Oracle environmental variables.  Many people
do this incorrectly and spend days trying to get a working version of
DBD-Oracle.  Below are examples of a local database and a remote database
(i.e. the database is on a different machine than your Perl/DBI/DBD
installation) environmental variable setup.
.PP
Example (local database):
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    export ORACLE_USERID=<validuser/validpasswd>
\&    export ORACLE_HOME=<path to oracle>
\&    export ORACLE_SID=<a valid instance>
\&    export SHLIB_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib       #for 32bit HP
\&    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib  #for 64bit HP (I defined them both)
.Ve
.PP
Note that HP-UX supports \fIboth\fR \s-1SHLIB_PATH \s0\fIand\fR \s-1LD_LIBRARY_PATH\s0 for
all libraries that need to be found, but that each library itself can
enable or disable any of the two, and can also set preference for the
order they are used, so please set them to the same value.
.PP
Example (remote database):
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    export ORACLE_USERID=<validuser/validpasswd>
\&    export ORACLE_HOME=<path to oracle>
\&    export ORACLE_SID=@<valid tnsnames.ora entry>
\&    export SHLIB_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib       #for 32bit HP
\&    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib  #for 64bit HP (I defined them both)
.Ve
.PP
The standard mantra now works out of the box on HP-UX:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    cd DBD\-Oracle\-1.07  # or more recent version
\&    perl Makefile.PL
\&    make
\&    make test
\&    make install        # if all went smoothly
.Ve
.PP
And with \s-1DBD\-1.14\s0 and later the following can be used:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    cd DBD\-Oracle\-1.14  # or more recent version
\&    perl Makefile.PL \-l # uses a simple link to oracle\*(Aqs main library
\&    make
\&    make test
\&    make install        # if all went smoothly
.Ve
.PP

hints of what might be wrong... and send me a note, describing your
configuration, and what you did to fix it.
.SH "Trouble Shooting"
.IX Header "Trouble Shooting"
.ie n .SS """Unresolved symbol"""
.el .SS "``Unresolved symbol''"
.IX Subsection "Unresolved symbol"
In general, find the symbols, edit the Makefile, and make test.
.PP
You'll have to modify the recipe accordingly, in my case the symbol
\&\*(L"LhtStrCreate\*(R" was unresolved. (Authors Note: thanks patch suggestions
by Jay Strauss this situation which occurs with Oracle 8.1.6 should
now be handled in Makefile.PL.)
.PP
1) Find the symbols.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&   a) The following ksh/bash code (courtesy of Roger) will search
\&      from $ORACLE_HOME and below for Symbols in files in lib directories.
\&      Save the following to a file called "findSymbol".
\&
\&   >>>>  CUT HERE <<<<<
\&   cd $ORACLE_HOME
\&
\&   echo "\enThis takes a while, grepping a lot of stuff"
\&   echo "   ignore the \e"no symbols\e" warnings\en"
\&
\&   sym=$1; shift;
\&   libs="*.sl"
\&
\&   for lib in  $(find . \-name $libs \-print); do
\&      if nm \-p $lib | grep \-q $sym; then
\&         echo "found \e"$sym\e" in $lib"
\&      fi
\&   done
\&   >>>>> CUT HERE <<<<
\&
\&      Note that on Itanium machines (HP\-UX 11.23), the shared libraries
\&      have a .so extension instead of the .sl HP\-UX uses on PA\-RISC.
\&
\&   b) Run it (replace "LhtStrCreate" with your "Unresolved symbol").
\&      For example, at my installation, findSymbols produced the
\&      following output:
\&
\&      # chmod 755 findSymbols
\&      # ./findSymbol LhtStrCreate
\&
\&      found "LhtStrCreate" in ./lib/libagtsh.sl
\&      found "LhtStrCreate" in ./lib/libclntsh.sl
\&      found "LhtStrCreate" in ./lib/libwtc8.sl
.Ve
.PP
2) Edit the Makefile
.PP
In the previous step your unresolved symbol was found in one or more
library files.  You will need to edit the \s-1OTHERLDFLAGS\s0 makefile macro,
and add the missing libraries.
.PP
When you add those library files to \s-1OTHERLDFLAGS\s0 you must convert the
name from the actual name to the notation that \s-1OTHERLDFLAGS\s0 uses.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&      libclntsh.sl         becomes =>   \-lclntsh
\&      libagtsh.sl          becomes =>   \-lagtsh
\&      libwtc8.sl           becomes =>   \-lwtc8
.Ve
.PP
That is, you replace the \*(L"lib\*(R" in the name to \*(L"\-l\*(R" and remove the \*(L".sl\*(R"
(or the .so).
.PP
You can edit the Makefile in 2 ways:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   a) Do this:
\&
\&      perl \-pi \-e\*(Aqs/\eb(OTHERLDFLAGS.*$)/$1 \-lclntsh/\*(Aq Makefile
\&
\&   b) Using vi, emacs... edit the file, find OTHERLDFLAGS, and add the
\&      above "\-l" entries to the end of the line.
\&
\&      For example the line:
\&      OTHERLDFLAGS =  \-L/opt/oracle/product/8.1.6/lib/... \-lqsmashr
\&
\&      Becomes:
\&      OTHERLDFLAGS =  \-L/opt/oracle/product/8.1.6/lib/... \-lqsmashr \-lclntsh
.Ve
.PP
3) make test
.PP
Perform a make test, if symbols are still unresolved repeat the editing
of the Makefile and make test again.
.SH "DBD\-Oracle\-1.06"

This may seem obvious to some, but the Oracle software has to be present
to compile and run DBD-Oracle.  The best way to compile and install on a
client machine, is to use the oracle installer to install the oracle
(client) software locally.  Install SQL*Net, Pro*C and SQL*Plus.  After
this some tests with SQL*Net (tnsping at a minimum) are an good idea.
Make sure you can connect to your remote database, and everything works
with Oracle before you start bashing your head into the wall trying to
get DBD-Oracle to work.

If you do not have the Oracle installer handy, the following hack has
been known to work:

\&\-L${\s-1ORACLE_HOME\s0}/JRE/lib/PA_RISC/native_threads \-ljava, was added
because DBD::Oracle wants to link with it (probably due to Oracle's own
build rules picked up by Makefile.PL)
.PP
Set environment variable \s-1LDOPTS\s0 to '+s' (see \fIld\fR\|(1)). This holds extra
parameters to HP-UX's ld command, as I don't use \s-1GNU\s0 ld (does anybody?).
This allows you to build an executable, which when run would search for
dynamic linked libraries using \s-1SHLIB_PATH \s0(for 32\-bit executable) and
\&\s-1LD_LIBRARY_PATH \s0(for 64\-bit executable). Obviously \s-1LDOPTS\s0 is needed only
when building Perl _and_ \s-1DBI +\s0 DBD::Oracle.
.PP
Then, after building Perl + \s-1DBI +\s0 DBD::Oracle and moving it into
production environment it was enough to add to \s-1SHLIB_PATH\s0
${\s-1ORACLE_HOME\s0}/lib and ${\s-1ORACLE_HOME\s0}/JRE/lib/PA_RISC/native_threads,

All of this mess is necessary because of weakness of shl_load(3X),
explained in this document and in some discussion forums at \s-1HP\s0.com
site. I have learned, that \s-1HP\s0 issued patch \s-1PHSS_24304\s0 for HP-UX 11.11
and \s-1PHSS_24303\s0 for HP-UX 11.00, which introduced variable \s-1LD_PRELOAD.
I\s0 haven't tried it yet, but it seems promising that it would allow you
to completely avoid building your own Perl binary, as it would be enough
to set \s-1LD_PRELOAD\s0 to libjava.sl (for example) and all
\&'Cannot load XXXlibrary' during building of DBD::Oracle should be gone.
.PP
The documentation says, that setting this variable should have the same
effect as linking binary with this library. Also please note, that this
variable is used only when binary is not setuid nor setgid binary (for
obvious security reasons).
.PP
It seems, that the best way to find out if you already have this patch
applied, is to check if 'man 5 dld.sl' says anything about \s-1LD_PRELOAD\s0
environment variable.
.PP
Best regards,
.PP
Waldemar Zurowski
.PP
Authors Note:  Search for references to \s-1LD_PRELOAD\s0 else where in this
document.  Using \s-1LD_PRELOAD\s0 is probably a fragile solution at best.
Better to do what Waldemar actually did, which is to include libjava in
the extra link options.

One of the most significant \*(L"mappings\*(R" was to take your suggestion under

The appl_setup sets some Oracle variables (specific to our installation),

The answer is there are too many to count, but here are several big ones:
.IP "1 Much smaller executables" 4

Only the code referenced gets loaded... this
means faster execution times, and less machine resources (\s-1VM\s0) used)

This is \s-1HUGE. \s0 One does not relink \fB\s-1EVERYTHING, EVERY\s0 time\fR one changes
or updates  a module.
.IP "3 It eliminates Dynaloader warning (multiply defined)." 4
.IX Item "3 It eliminates Dynaloader warning (multiply defined)."
This occurs with the static build when Perl is run with \-w.  I fixed
this by removing \-w from my #! lines, converting the pragam \*(L"use
warnings;\*(R". However, it was annoying, since all my scripts had \-w in the
#! line.
.IP "4 It's the default build" 4
.IX Item "4 It's the default build"
Since almost every \s-1OS\s0 now supports dynamic linking, I believe that static
linking is \s-1NOT\s0 getting the same level of vetting it maybe used to.
Dynamicly linking is what you get by default, so its way better tested.
